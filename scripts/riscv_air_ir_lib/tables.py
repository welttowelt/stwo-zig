"""Shared RISC-V preprocessed lookup-table membership, per relation domain.

Transcribed from `src/frontends/riscv/air/lookups/tables/schema.zig` (`Kind`,
`logSize`, `arity`, `tupleAt`) and from `air/lookups/entry.zig` (`Domain`,
`expectedArity`).  Those files stay the source of truth: the widths here are a
restatement for a different toolchain, and `test_air_uniqueness.py` cross-checks
them against the Zig so the restatement cannot drift silently.

Three classes of domain, and the classification is the single most important
thing a reviewer must agree with:

  BOX     a fixed preprocessed table whose rows are exactly the tuples inside a
          product of bit-width boxes.  A live request means each component lies
          in its box.  Encodable per row.
  BITWISE the 2^18-row (lhs, rhs, value, op) table.  Membership is the box on
          (lhs, rhs, op) plus a functional definition of `value`.
  BUS     not a table at all -- registers/memory/program/Poseidon2 relations are
          multiset buses closed across rows and components.  A per-row query
          learns nothing from them and asserts nothing.
