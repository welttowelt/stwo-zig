"""Independent row-satisfaction and LogUp-closure checker for exported RISC-V
proving runs.

WHAT THIS CHECKS INDEPENDENTLY
------------------------------
Given the complete committed main trace exported from a real proving run, plus
the extracted per-family opcode constraint IR, it re-decides in Python:

  1. the committed-row placement permutation — the export is in committed
     (circle-domain, bit-reversed) order and this reader undoes it itself;
  2. every direct constraint of every real opcode row, over M31;
  3. every direct constraint of program, RW-memory, Merkle, Poseidon2 and clock
     rows, including their padding policy;
  4. every activated preprocessed-table request, including the exact sparse
     multiplicity columns of all six lookup tables;
  5. every opcode and infrastructure LogUp claim, recomputed from the committed
     trace and the exported challenges rather than read from the prover;
  6. all 28 canonical transcript claim slots, including zero slots for absent
     opcode families and aggregation of memory/opcode shards;
  7. the verifier's public boundary compensation, as a second implementation of
     `air/public_logup.zig`;
  8. global LogUp cancellation using only recomputed component claims and the
     recomputed public boundary.

It shares no code with the Zig evaluator. A bug in Zig's row evaluation loop,
its committed-row placement, its column offsets, or its public-boundary
arithmetic cannot hide in both.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT CHECK
------------------------
This is NOT a verifier and must not be read as one. Everything below is out of
scope, and a green result says nothing about any of it:

  * the proof wire — PCS commitments, Merkle openings, FRI, the composition
    polynomial, the out-of-domain sampling, and the Fiat-Shamir transcript are
    never touched. Nothing here reads the proof;
  * the binding between the export and the proof. The export is taken from the
    prover's committed buffers at the point they are handed to the commitment
    scheme, which is a code-level identity (see `prover/test_trace_dump.zig`),
    not a cryptographic one. This checker cannot tell that the values it read
    are the values the proof opens;
  * opcode padding rows. The extracted opcode IR fixes the preprocessed
    `is_active` selector to one, so it is the active-row system. Infrastructure
    padding is checked independently;
  * the bus relations. `registers_state`, `memory_access`, `program_access`,
    `merkle`, `poseidon2` and `poseidon2_io` are multiset buses closed across
    rows and components. Their tuples enter (4) and (6) but are never decided
    row-locally, because a per-row query cannot decide them;
  * whether the extracted IR is the shipped AIR. That is established separately,
    by the fixed-seed extraction differential in
    `src/tests/riscv/uniqueness_ir_test.zig`. Without it, this checker would be
    comparing a trace against a model of unknown provenance.

Usage
-----
    python3 -m scripts.air_satisfaction explain
    python3 -m scripts.air_satisfaction check [--dump PATH] [--ir DIR]
        [--max-report N]

`check` exits 0 when every row is satisfied and the ledger closes, and 1
otherwise. Inputs are produced by
`src/tests/riscv/committed_trace_export_test.zig` (`zig-out/committed-trace/`)
and `src/tests/riscv/uniqueness_ir_test.zig` (`zig-out/uniqueness-ir/`).
