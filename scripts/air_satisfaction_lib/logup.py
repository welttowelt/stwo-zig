"""Independent LogUp accounting for one exported proving run.

Two computations, and the difference between them matters:

  * `opcode_claim` RECOMPUTES a component's claimed sum from the committed
    trace, the extracted lookup requests and the exported challenges.  Nothing
    from the prover's interaction layer enters it, so a disagreement with the
    exported claim is a real discrepancy between the trace and the claim the
    verifier will be handed.
  * `relation_claim` RECOMPUTES every infrastructure component from its exact
    committed main trace (including sparse table multiplicities).
  * `public_boundary` RECOMPUTES the verifier's public compensation from the
    public statement alone.  This is a second implementation of
    `air/public_logup.zig`, anchored by the pinned Rust-oracle vector in
    `scripts/tests/test_air_satisfaction.py`.

No interaction claim is taken as given. Pair batching is intentionally erased:
the sum of the individual fractions is the claim regardless of which adjacent
terms the Zig interaction generator paired.
