"""Anti-sprawl ratchet: every script must be reachable from a live entry point.

A script in scripts/ earns its place by being wired into the build graph, a
hosted workflow, a conformance policy, a hook, the docs, or another reachable
script — or by being declared in OPERATOR_TOOLS below with an owner and a
one-line purpose. Anything else is dead code and fails this test, so orphans
can never accumulate silently again. Deletion is cheap: everything is
restorable from history.
