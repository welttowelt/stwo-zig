"""One reusable verdict interface over the pinned Sail oracle.

Answers exactly one question: does the pinned Sail model agree with a
runner retirement trace? Callers receive one of four verdicts:

  EQUIVALENT   Sail retired the same sequence on every compared field
               (pc, instruction, rd, rd_value, next_pc, and the five
               memory-effect fields).
  DIVERGENT    Sail was consulted and contradicts the trace. Fail loudly.
  UNAVAILABLE  The pinned Sail binary cannot be consulted on this host.
               Skip VISIBLY, naming what was not checked.
  ERROR        The inputs or the RVFI-DII transport are broken. Fail
               loudly; skipping here lets a harness bug read as coverage.

UNAVAILABLE is decided strictly before the oracle is consulted: the
binary is missing, or exists but fails the pinned identity check
(model tag, Sail compiler version, transport-patch hash). Once a
verified binary starts answering, nothing downgrades to UNAVAILABLE --
conflating "the oracle is absent" with "the oracle disagrees" is how a
dead oracle starts to look like a passing one.

Exit codes mirror verdicts: 0 EQUIVALENT, 1 DIVERGENT, 2 ERROR,
3 UNAVAILABLE. stdout is a single JSON report; humans and Zig tests
parse the same object. Comparison semantics live in
scripts/riscv_equivalence.py; this module adds only resolution,
classification, and the report shape.

  python3 scripts/riscv_sail_oracle.py probe
  python3 scripts/riscv_sail_oracle.py check --elf guest.elf --trace trace.json \
      [--memory initial_memory.json]

--memory declares the memory image the runner started from (ELF data, the
public-input region), seeded into Sail with its own stores before replay:
RVFI-DII injects instructions without loading the ELF, so without it a load
of runner-initialized memory would falsely diverge against Sail's zeroed
memory. The image comes from the guest's definition, never from the trace.

The binary is resolved from, in order: --sail-bin, $STWO_RISCV_SAIL_BIN,
$STWO_RISCV_FORMAL_WORKSPACE, then the documented default workspace
/tmp/stwo-riscv-formal (scripts/riscv_formal_tools.py prepare). The
first candidate that is configured wins and must verify; a configured
but wrong binary is never silently papered over by a later candidate.
