"""Measure which operand classes an existing trace corpus actually touches.

The enumeration in `classes` defines the operand space worth testing; this
module answers "which of it does the current corpus exercise?". Input is
canonical retirement traces (`riscv-trace-dump` output). Operand values
are recovered by replaying each trace's retired instruction words through
the pinned Sail model and folding Sail's rd_value stream into a register
file -- the same Sail-derived recovery generation uses -- so the coverage
verdict is grounded in the oracle rather than in a Python re-execution of
our own semantics.

The report's `untouched` list is the finding: every (opcode, class) pair
the enumeration reaches and the audited corpus never does.
