# Cairo superiority campaign

## Status

Open campaign on branch `autoresearch/cairo-native-throughput-10x`, based on
head `ad2d3ac5`. The objective is to make the Zig Cairo prover faster than the
pinned Rust `stwo-cairo` prover on the same host. This is not a Native-board
promotion: the autoresearch manifest does not score the Cairo frontend.

Implementation model: Claude Opus 4.5. Orchestration: Claude Fable 5.

Every increment must preserve exact proof bytes, statement validation,
protocol parameters, and backend capability declarations. Admission of any
fast path must follow structural properties — byte volume, run counts,
fragmentation — never a workload name, input path, fixture digest, or target
shape.

## Increment 1: CPU FRI quotient fragmentation

**Outcome: negative audit. No defect found, no source change.**

### Motivation

The accepted Metal quotient candidate in
`autoresearch/notes/2026-07-27-cairo-system-throughput/note.md` fixed a real
fragmentation defect: arithmetic-2m supplies 1.821 GB of raw quotient columns
in 361 physical source runs, and a historical `raw_bytes >= 64 MiB` predicate
launched one full-domain numerator pass **per run**. Gathering those inputs
once into a flat private arena took the stage from 1,350 ms to 212 ms, a 6.37x
win.

The CPU lane was described as retaining the proven flat pack only for *small*
fragmented inputs, which suggested the same byte-keyed exclusion might be
starving large Cairo workloads. CPU `fri_quotient_build_and_commit` is a real
cost centre — 601 ms on memory-7m and 278 ms on arithmetic-2m in the head
profiles at `/private/tmp/cairo-direct-feed-portfolio-v1/cpu-*.stages.json` —
so the hypothesis was worth testing.

### Mechanism as actually implemented

The CPU quotient path is structurally different from the Metal path and does
not have the defect.

A CPU quotient input is not a segmented buffer. `ColumnEvaluation`
(`src/prover/pcs/quotient_column_geometry.zig:19`) is one contiguous
`[]const M31` per column with a `log_size`; there are no physical source runs
to gather. What the Metal lane calls fragmentation appears on the CPU as
*implicit lifting*: a column smaller than the lifting domain repeats each
even/odd source pair across a `2^shift_amt`-row run.

For any lifting domain of `2^13` rows or more
(`src/prover/pcs/quotient_tile_executor.zig:27`), the provider selects
`.bounded_cpu` and builds two plans
(`src/prover/pcs/quotients/lazy_provider.zig:219-241`):

- `planning.buildCompactContributionPlan`
  (`src/prover/pcs/quotients/planning.zig:388`) folds every implicitly lifted
  contribution (`shift_amt >= 2`) into groups keyed by
  `(sample batch, source value count, shift)`.
- `quotient_direct_plan.build` (`src/prover/pcs/quotient_direct_plan.zig:17`)
  keeps only the remaining full-domain columns as direct views.

Execution makes exactly **one** fused, tiled pass over the domain
(`src/prover/pcs/quotient_tile_executor.zig:182` `executeBatched`). Inside each
256-row tile, `accumulateTile`
(`src/prover/pcs/quotient_tile_executor.zig:240`) walks compact groups and
direct views into output-stationary numerator planes.
`quotient_compact_groups.zig:35` reduces all members of a group to one even/odd
pair per lifted run and broadcasts that pair once across the run;
`quotient_direct_groups.zig:33` fuses four direct columns per pass when they
share a sample batch and have a single contribution each.

So the per-row work already scales with *groups*, not with source columns or
source runs. There is no per-run domain walk, no repeated denominator
inversion per source run, and no segmented gather.

### Audit measurements

Temporary instrumentation was added to
`src/prover/pcs/quotients/lazy_provider.zig` and
`src/prover/pcs/quotient_tile_executor.zig`, gated behind a
`STWO_QUOTIENT_AUDIT` environment probe, then reverted before commit. It
counted plan shape and summed per-phase worker time.

| Quantity | arithmetic-2m | memory-7m |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Lifting log size / domain rows | 22 / 4,194,304 | 23 / 8,388,608 |
| Flattened columns | 761 | 882 |
| Active columns | 646 | 768 |
| Active non-zero columns | 472 | 611 |
| Raw quotient column volume | 1,166.298 MiB | 4,139.296 MiB |
| Sample batches | 14 | 16 |
| Compact plan admitted | yes | yes |
| Compact groups | 26 | 36 |
| Compact members | 550 | 704 |
| Direct views | 50 | 59 |
| Tiles (256 rows each) | 16,398 | 32,778 |
| Full-domain passes | 1 | 1 |
| Numerator streams per tile | 43 | 56 |
| Four-way fused direct passes per tile | 11 of 17 | 13 of 20 |

Two facts close the hypothesis.

First, the compact plan is admitted at both sizes. The
`MAX_COMPACT_GROUP_BYTES = 1 MiB` budget
(`src/prover/pcs/quotients/lazy_provider.zig:34`) bounds **plan metadata
only** — `CompactContributionMember` is 32 bytes, so 550 members cost 17.6 KiB
and 704 members cost 22.0 KiB, 1.7% and 2.2% of the budget. The budget is not
a function of raw column volume and does not exclude large inputs. There is no
CPU analog of the Metal `raw_bytes >= 64 MiB` predicate.

Second, the collapse ratio is already near the achievable floor: 472 active
non-zero source columns reduce to 43 numerator-plane read-modify-write streams
per tile on arithmetic-2m, and 611 reduce to 56 on memory-7m. Total domain
passes equal one in both cases (tiles x 256 rows exactly equals the domain
size).

Phase split, worker-summed, arithmetic-2m, single cold process, wall stage
277.1 ms in the same process:

| Phase | Worker-summed ms | Share |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Numerator accumulation (`accumulateTile`) | 474.8 | 44.4% |
| Finalize + tile emit (includes fused Merkle) | 370.3 | 34.6% |
| Denominator batch inversion (`prepareBatchMajor`) | 182.5 | 17.1% |
| Bit-reversed domain walk | 28.7 | 2.7% |
| Numerator plane clear | 12.8 | 1.2% |

memory-7m, same instrumentation build, wall stage 630.3 ms: accumulation
1,994.7 ms, finalize + emit 845.3 ms, denominator inversion 459.0 ms, domain
walk 62.4 ms, clear 36.4 ms.

These phase timings carry instrumentation overhead (five `Instant.now()` calls
and five atomic accumulations per tile) and were taken under a shared host, so
treat them as shares rather than absolute costs. The plan-shape counts are
exact.

### Verdict

R7 closes negative. The CPU FRI quotient path is run-ceiling-bounded already:
one fused domain pass, group-collapsed accumulation, and a compact-plan
predicate that admits the largest measured Cairo inputs. Porting the Metal
remedy would be a no-op because the condition it repairs never occurs here.

### Paired measurement and noise floor

Because the increment ships no source change, the A-B-B-A run compares two
builds of the same sources: the pristine predecessor tree copied to
`/private/tmp/campaign-inc1-pred/zig-out` before any edit, and a fresh rebuild
after the instrumentation was reverted. Its value is not a treatment effect —
there is none — but a calibration of this host's noise floor, which every
later increment in the campaign must clear.

Cold processes, interleaved pred/cand/cand/pred, `--verify` on every run, no
sample discarded.

| Workload | Arm | Prove ms | Quotient stage ms |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| arithmetic-2m | pred 1 | 3,142.939 | 300.489 |
| arithmetic-2m | cand 1 | 3,296.576 | 342.335 |
| arithmetic-2m | cand 2 | 3,202.980 | 331.860 |
| arithmetic-2m | pred 2 | 3,178.248 | 300.461 |
| memory-7m | pred 1 | 7,392.830 | 617.102 |
| memory-7m | cand 1 | 7,584.830 | 623.093 |
| memory-7m | cand 2 | 7,591.878 | 607.022 |
| memory-7m | pred 2 | 7,437.917 | 602.469 |
| all-opcodes | pred 1 | 1,643.247 | 138.474 |
| all-opcodes | cand 1 | 1,603.982 | 137.453 |

| Workload | Pred mean prove ms | Cand mean prove ms | Ratio | Pred mean quotient ms | Cand mean quotient ms | Ratio |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| arithmetic-2m | 3,160.594 | 3,249.778 | 1.028x | 300.475 | 337.098 | 1.122x |
| memory-7m | 7,415.374 | 7,588.354 | 1.023x | 609.786 | 615.058 | 1.009x |
| all-opcodes | 1,643.247 | 1,603.982 | 0.976x | 138.474 | 137.453 | 0.993x |

Identical sources therefore produced spreads of -2.4% to +2.8% on complete
prove time and up to +12.2% on the quotient stage alone. **Any future
single-digit-percent claim on this host is inside the noise and must not be
accepted without more samples or a quieter machine.**

Host load: the block opened at load average 4.57 and closed at 10.86.
Contamination was real and is reported rather than hidden. An unrelated
`test-riscv-release-exhaustive` suite ran in another checkout for the entire
session, and the Metal product build overlapped the first arithmetic-2m
samples. A-B-B-A adjacency is the only defence applied.

### Verification

- Proof bytes byte-identical across arms on every workload:
  arithmetic-2m `25e5719f4c578eb7ef10d76d6033e65f0a4a9d981c2414c3f7ac1950966deea6`,
  memory-7m `e3317e55a5db5a4251e04827b3d4f2ccaeb801feb6a9d2848e71ef23daced994`,
  all-opcodes `79ae76e1ac0c48b1e3b06810ddb1fed8aabe5dfb10d028e879105b79716cb310`.
- Metal arithmetic-2m proof digest equals the CPU digest
  `25e5719f4c578eb7ef10d76d6033e65f0a4a9d981c2414c3f7ac1950966deea6`, with
  `classification: accelerated_without_fallbacks`, 74 Metal dispatches and
  `cpu_fallbacks: 0`.
- Pinned official Rust verifier accepted the candidate arithmetic-2m proof:
  `verified: true`, channel `blake2s`, proof digest
  `25e5719f4c578eb7ef10d76d6033e65f0a4a9d981c2414c3f7ac1950966deea6`.
- `zig build test-cairo-cpu-product test-cairo-frontend -Doptimize=ReleaseFast`
  passed; product closure PASS over 326 transitive Zig sources; identity
  reported `dirty: false`.
- Harness note for later increments: a copied product binary needs its whole
  `zig-out` tree. `execution_adapter.zig:116` resolves `stwo-cairo-vm-adapter`
  beside the executable and `profile.zig:140` resolves the params manifest at
  `<exe_dir>/../share/stwo-zig/cairo/official/all_opcodes.params.json`.

### Rejected alternatives

- **Port the Metal flat-arena gather to the CPU.** Rejected: CPU columns are
  already contiguous. A gather would copy 1.17 GB (arithmetic-2m) or 4.14 GB
  (memory-7m) to produce data the tile executor can already read in place.
- **Raise `MAX_COMPACT_GROUP_BYTES`.** Rejected: measured metadata use is 1.7%
  and 2.2% of the existing budget, so the constant is not binding on any
  measured workload. Changing it would be an unmeasurable no-op.
- **Merge compact groups that share a sample batch but differ in shift.**
  Would cut arithmetic-2m from 26 compact streams to at most 14, about 12 of
  43 numerator streams. M31 addition is associative and commutative so exact
  bytes would survive, but the projected saving is roughly 28% of 44% of a
  277 ms stage — under 1% of a 5.3 s proof — against a real correctness risk
  in merging runs with different block boundaries. Not worth this increment's
  budget; recorded for the roadmap.
- **Widen the direct-column fusion beyond four.** The existing four-way fusion
  already fires on 11 of 17 direct passes (arithmetic-2m) and 13 of 20
  (memory-7m); the residue is a tail of odd counts, not a systematic miss.

## Increment 2: direct interaction coordinate emission

**Outcome: accepted candidate.** Source change on
`src/frontends/cairo/witness/interaction_source.zig`,
`src/frontends/cairo/witness/interaction_trace.zig`,
`src/frontends/cairo/conformance/recorded_interaction.zig`,
`src/frontends/cairo/proving/interaction_trace.zig`, plus one unchecked
constructor in `src/core/fields/m31.zig`. Exact proof bytes preserved on every
measured workload.

Implementation: Claude Opus 4.5. Orchestration: Claude Fable 5.

### Audit

One cold predecessor profile of arithmetic-2m attributes
`Interaction trace build` = 362.083 ms as:

| Bucket | ms | Share |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Relation fraction construction + batch inversion + consumption | 278.533 | 76.9% |
| QM31 → four-coordinate lowering | 40.665 | 11.2% |
| Memory multiplicity collection | 16.008 | 4.4% |
| Fixed-table multiplicity collection | 11.141 | 3.1% |
| Source construction, topology compile, allocation | 15.736 | 4.3% |

`add_opcode_small` alone is 143.572 ms of the total; `range_check_20` 36.308,
`memory_address_to_id` 23.567, `range_check_9_9` 21.590.

Two redundant materializations were found between component emission and the
four `SecureColumnByCoords` coordinate columns.

1. **Per-element layout dispatch.** The predecessor `Reference.evaluateRange`
   walked row-major and called `SourceView.relationWord(kind, arg, word, row)`
   once per relation word per row. That accessor re-executes the complete
   layout dispatch every call — a `rows()` union switch, a row bound, a
   `word == 0` guard, a storage-tag switch, a kind check, overflow-checked
   index arithmetic, then two more bounds checks and a canonicality branch
   inside `LookupColumns.value` / `SparseColumns.value`. None of it depends on
   `row`. `SourceView.multiplicity` had the same shape, and the combine's
   word-0 term `-z + alpha^0 * use[3]` is a per-use constant that was rebuilt
   on every row.
2. **The interleaved secure trace.** `materializeTrace` allocated a complete
   `column_count × row_count` QM31 trace, and
   `proving/interaction_trace.zig` then ran `lowerCoordinates` over it — a
   second complete pass that reads every QM31 and writes
   `value.toM31Array()[coordinate]` into four freshly allocated M31 planes.
   Every committed value was written twice with one read in between, purely
   because the intermediate existed. That is the 40.665 ms bucket.

### Mechanism as implemented

`SourceView.resolveWord` and `SourceView.resolveMultiplicity`
(`src/frontends/cairo/witness/interaction_source.zig:288`, `:333`) are hoisted
forms of `relationWord` and `multiplicity`. They perform the layout dispatch,
index arithmetic and bounds validation once per use and return a `WordAccess` /
`MultiplicityAccess` whose common arm is a bare `[*]const u32` over the
borrowed column. The element accessors remain for `evaluateRow` and the fixture
oracles, and a new test walks seven source layouts × every word × every row
asserting the resolved reader equals the element accessor.

`Reference.init` (`src/frontends/cairo/witness/interaction_trace.zig:156`) now
builds a plan — `terms`, `uses`, `column_plans` — once per component per
worker. `combineUse` (`:414`) folds one use across a whole row run, four rows
per iteration, because the accumulator is a serial `add` chain and the loop is
latency-bound. Canonicality of dense words is validated with a running
lane-wise `@max` over the run rather than a branch per element, which is why
`M31.fromU32Unchecked` was added alongside the existing `CM31`/`QM31` unchecked
constructors.

Consumption (`evaluateRangeInto`, `:326`) is tiled at 1,024 rows and
**column-major**: one running cumulative tile is folded through every relation
column in order and each finished column leaves as a contiguous run.
`CoordinateSink` splits that run directly into the four committed `[]M31`
planes. Only the last interaction column is still staged as QM31, because its
committed values are `scanLastColumnInPlace`'s circle-order rewrite of the row
totals and that scan needs the claimed sum. `lowerCoordinates` is deleted from
the prover path; `SecureSink` keeps the column-major QM31 form for conformance
so both sinks share one evaluator and cannot drift.

`allocateCoordinateColumns` leaves the planes uninitialized: the straight-line
writer provably covers every destination row, the same predicate the
direct-feed change established for base-trace feeds.

Nothing dispatches on program name, path, digest, or shape. The plan is derived
from the relation descriptors and the source layout tag only.

Exactness: the only reorderings are summation order (claimed sum accumulated
per tile, not per row) and batch-inversion grouping (use-major, not row-major,
within the same batch). M31/QM31 addition is exact modular arithmetic and
therefore associative, and a field inverse is unique, so neither can move a
bit. Byte parity below confirms it.

### S1 counter evidence

Two `stwo-prof zig` harnesses wired against live repo sources. The generated
`build.zig` in each scratch dir was edited to give the Cairo module its real
`stwo_core` dependency, since the default wiring is flat and cannot express a
dep-of-a-dep. Both arms call the same live `SourceView` accessors, the same
live QM31 arithmetic and the same live `batchInverseInPlace`; the predecessor
arm reproduces only the traversal shape, which is the thing under test. Shape:
32,768 rows (the real parallel batch), 64 source columns, 16 relation columns ×
2 uses × 6 words.

| Counter | elementwise (pred) | planned (cand) | Ratio |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| instructions/op | 13,300 | 9,226 | **1.442x fewer** |
| cycles/op | 2,368 | 2,008 | 1.179x fewer |
| ns/op (median) | 550.1 | 466.7 | 1.179x |
| IPC | 5.618 | 4.595 | — |

`stwo-prof zig compare cairo-combine-elementwise cairo-combine-planned
--iters 8 --rounds 7`: wall B/A `0.8466`, CI95 `[0.841828, 0.85203]`, verdict
"B faster"; instr B/A `0.6937`; cycles B/A `0.8504`. The CI excludes 1.0. The
instruction ratio is the mechanism confirmation — 30.6% fewer instructions for
identical output is what removing per-element dispatch predicts. Falling IPC is
expected: the same work in fewer instructions raises per-instruction memory
pressure.

At a smaller shape (8,192 rows, 24 columns, 8 relation columns) the instruction
ratio was 1.374x but wall barely moved (230.9 → 222.6 ns/op) at IPC 6.16 — the
removed instructions were absorbed by superscalar slack in a cache-resident
working set. Recorded because it is the reason the batch-scale numbers are the
ones quoted.

### Paired stage and prove measurement

A-B-B-A cold processes, `--verify` on every run, predecessor = pristine
`zig-out` tree of head `196a679f` copied whole before any edit, no sample
discarded.

**Host load must be read with these numbers.** This first block opened at load
average 10.35 and closed at 57.79: an unrelated `zig clang` build storm in
another checkout ran throughout. Absolute prove times are roughly 2.3x inflated
against increment 1's figures on the same binaries and workloads
(arithmetic-2m 7.2 s here versus 3.16 s there). A-B-B-A adjacency is the only
defence applied, and it is why only *ratios* are read from it. The stage ratios
1.73x / 2.00x / 1.41x are far outside increment 1's measured ±12% stage-level
floor; the prove ratios 1.03-1.07x are inside the ±3% prove-level floor and are
not claimed from this block. It is retained because it is real interleaved
data and because its agreement with the quiet block below is itself evidence.

#### Repeat block on a quiet host

The interfering build eventually drained and the complete A-B-B-A block was
repeated, opening at load average 9.02 and closing at 7.07. Absolute times are
now consistent with increment 1's figures on the same workloads
(arithmetic-2m predecessor prove 3,243 ms here versus 3,161 ms there;
memory-7m 7,023 versus 7,415), so this block, not the loaded one, is the
measurement of record. The candidate binary is the same sources rebuilt at
clean commit `383e0ac2`; the predecessor tree is untouched.

| memory-7m | 7,022.962 | 6,341.038 | 1.108x | 882.993 | 483.929 | **1.825x** | 667.374 | 374.195 | 1.783x |
| all-opcodes | 1,495.978 | 1,465.845 | 1.021x | 153.656 | 117.103 | **1.312x** | 120.098 | 110.216 | 1.090x |

**One bias in this block must be named.** The A-B-B-A order puts `pred 1`
first for every workload, and the first sample of each workload is cold in the
page cache. On arithmetic-2m `pred 1` is 26% above `pred 2` on the stage
(469.653 versus 372.975) and 18% above on prove; the two candidate samples,
both taken warm, agree within 2%. Averaging the predecessor arm therefore
flatters the candidate. The conservative reading discards `pred 1` and compares
the candidate mean against the warmed `pred 2` alone:

| Workload | Build ratio vs pred 2 | Prove ratio vs pred 2 |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| arithmetic-2m | 1.601x | 1.076x |
| memory-7m | 1.759x | 1.072x |
| all-opcodes | 1.309x | 1.020x |

Both readings clear the 1.15x stage bar on all three workloads. At prove level
the conservative arithmetic-2m and memory-7m figures (1.076x, 1.072x) sit above
increment 1's ±3% floor and are claimed only weakly — two samples per arm is
thin for a 7% effect, and the correct follow-up is more samples, not a stronger
adjective. all-opcodes at prove level is inside the floor and is not claimed.

An independent quiet-host pair taken during the audit, load average 4.01 to
about 3.8, agrees with the stage result: arithmetic-2m `Interaction trace
build` 362.083 ms predecessor versus 204.850 ms candidate, `1.767x`, with
materialization 278.533 → 168.914 (`1.649x`), lowering 40.665 → 0, and
`add_opcode_small` 143.572 → 60.960 (`2.355x`).

Across all three independent blocks — loaded, quiet, and the audit pair — the
arithmetic-2m stage ratio lands at 1.725x, 1.809x and 1.767x. That stability
under a 2.3x swing in host load is the strongest argument that the effect is
the treatment and not the machine.

Acceptance: stage-level improvement ≥ 1.15x on all three workloads under both
the averaged and the conservative reading, and the S1 instruction ratio
confirms the mechanism. Accepted.

### Verification

- Proof bytes byte-identical predecessor versus candidate on every workload and
  every arm: arithmetic-2m
  `25e5719f4c578eb7ef10d76d6033e65f0a4a9d981c2414c3f7ac1950966deea6`,

  all-opcodes
  `79ae76e1ac0c48b1e3b06810ddb1fed8aabe5dfb10d028e879105b79716cb310`. All three
  equal the digests increment 1 recorded.

  `25e5719f4c578eb7ef10d76d6033e65f0a4a9d981c2414c3f7ac1950966deea6`, with
  `classification: accelerated_without_fallbacks`, 74 Metal dispatches and

  passed; product closure PASS over 326 transitive Zig sources; source
  conformance reported 5 explained legacy findings and no new violations.

### Rejected alternatives

- **Restructure the combine into a rows-SoA SIMD layout.** This was the
  original hypothesis and it is wrong. `QM31.mulM31`
  (`src/core/fields/qm31.zig:186`) is already a `mulVec4` and `QM31.add`
  (`:105`) an `addVec4`, both filling the 128-bit register with the four secure
  coordinates. A four-rows-per-vector SoA layout executes 4 × (2 multiply + 3
  fold + 2 add) NEON instructions per four rows per word — exactly the same
  count as the existing AoS form. There is no width to gain, only an AoS/SoA
  transposition to pay. The measured win is an instruction-count win from
  deleted dispatch, not a vectorization win, and the `asm` NEON share is
  unchanged by design.
- **Widen the combine unroll beyond four rows.** Four independent accumulator
  chains already cover the `mulVec4` + `addVec4` latency. Wider unrolls add
  live QM31 accumulators against the same 32 vector registers while each extra
  term also needs its alpha resident — the register-pressure regression the
  rejected 8-stream Merkle leaf change demonstrated. Not pursued; four is
  recorded as the tuned constant.
- **Defer the Mersenne reduction across four terms (`dot4Packed` style).**
  Four canonical products fit in `u64`, so one fold could serve four terms.
  Rejected: on AArch64 a `@Vector(4, u64)` multiply has no native NEON
  instruction and lowers to scalar or multi-instruction sequences, which costs
  more than the folds it saves.
- **Lower the last interaction column directly too.** Its committed values are
  the circle-order scan of the row totals, and the scan cannot start until the
  claimed sum is known, which is after every parallel range finishes. Staging
  one column instead of all of them keeps the scan a single sequential QM31
  pass; lowering it into four planes afterwards costs one column's traversal
  rather than the whole trace's.
- **Retune `batch_rows` (32,768) while restructuring.** It is the parallel work
  decomposition landed by `14975401` and changing it would confound this
  increment's treatment with a scheduling change. The consumption tile
  (1,024 rows) was introduced *inside* the batch instead, which gets the cache
  locality without touching the worker split.
- **Also fix the multiplicity collection stages.** `Fixed-table multiplicities`
  and `Memory multiplicities` are 27.1 ms of 362.083 ms on arithmetic-2m and
  live in `fixed_trace` / `cpu_memory`, not in the relation build. Below this
  increment's headroom; recorded for the roadmap.

## Increment 3: Merkle commit pipeline

**Outcome: rejected candidate.** A working, byte-exact structural change was
built, measured, and reverted: it improves the `merkle_commit` stage by
1.04x-1.13x, below this increment's 1.15x acceptance bar. The source diff is
reverted; the audit, the wall verdict, and the rejected mechanism are recorded
here because they retarget the remaining Merkle work.

Implementation: Claude Opus 4.5. Orchestration: Claude Fable 5.

The reverted implementation is preserved in history at `35dcf92e` (fused
trailing group) on top of the audit instrumentation at `495a9cff`.

### Audit: what the merkle_commit stage is made of

Cairo commits through the *streaming* path. `commitOwnedPreparedWithRecorder-
AndBacking` (`src/prover/pcs/scheme.zig:225`) routes any column set of 128 or
more columns to `commitOwnedStreamingWithRecorder`, and every Cairo tree
qualifies (156, 293, 304 columns on arithmetic-2m). `tree_builders.zig:283`
then hands the complete height-sorted set to
`StreamingCommitter.commitColumnsWithSparseTail`
(`src/prover/vcs_lifted/prover.zig:542`), so the whole leaf pipeline happens in
one call.

That pipeline keeps **one BLAKE2s hasher state per leaf**. `@sizeOf(H)` is
**136 bytes** (measured, not estimated: `h[8]u32`, `t0`, `t1`, a 64-byte
`buf`, `buf_len`, `finalized`, `selection`). For a `2^22` leaf domain the
array is **570 MiB**; memory-7m reaches `2^23` and **1.14 GiB**. It is built
by climbing the column log-size ladder: each new group replicates the array
onto the larger domain, then absorbs its columns into every entry.

Temporary instrumentation gated behind `STWO_MERKLE_AUDIT=1` split the stage
into replication, absorb, leaf finalize, parent layers and allocation. It was
reverted with the rest of the increment. arithmetic-2m, one cold process:

| Phase | ms | Share |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Leaf absorb (`updateHashersPacked`) | 496.1 | 37.1% |
| **Hasher-array replication (expand)** | 442.5 | 33.1% |
| Parent layers | 236.5 | 17.7% |
| Leaf finalize (`finalizeHashers`) | 160.5 | 12.0% |
| Leaf/layer allocation | 0.017 | 0.0% |
| Total | 1,335.6 | |

Per tree: preprocessed (156 columns, max log 21) 194.6 ms; main (293, log 22)
635.5 ms; interaction (304, log 22) 505.5 ms.

Two findings dominate.

**The replication phase does no hashing at all.** It is a third of the stage
spent copying hasher states. The single largest line item in the whole audit is
one replication: `expand log_size=22 leaves=4194304 hasher_bytes=570425344
ns=111428584` — 111.4 ms to move 855 MiB (285 read, 570 written) so that the
next group has somewhere to be absorbed into. At head it is also a **serial
scalar gather** (`prover.zig:505`, a plain `for (0..layer_size)` loop), while
absorb, finalize and the parent layers all run on the pool.

**The sparse-tail fast path never fires on Cairo.** `liftedTailStart`
(`prover.zig:563`) can already skip the last replication, but only if the
trailing columns fit in the currently-open 64-byte block — at most 15 columns
and only when few words are buffered. Every Cairo tree reports
`tail_start=null`: the trailing groups are 39, 20 and 4 columns wide against a
full buffer. The mechanism existed and was structurally excluded.

### Worker-cap finding

**The pool cap does not bind, and the brief's premise was stale.**
`work_pool.zig:13` declares `MAX_WORKERS = 32`, not 16, and
`parameters.max_parallel_workers` is also 32. On this 18-core host
`detectWorkerCount` returns 18. Instrumented worker counts confirm the leaf
paths actually receive them: `absorb_workers pool=true workers=18
layer=4194304`, dropping to 16/8/4/2/1 only as layers shrink below the
`parallel_min_nodes_per_worker = 1024` capacity rule. There is nothing to lift;
no rider was needed. The real parallelism defect was the *serial* replication
loop above, which the pool never saw.

### The wall verdict (four walls)

Two `stwo-prof zig` harnesses wired against live `stwo_core` sources
(`--import stwo_core=src/core/mod.zig`), single-threaded, shape `2^18` base
hashers → `2^19` leaves × 39 trailing columns. Both arms call the same live
`Blake2sHasher` primitives; only the traversal differs. Predecessor arm:
replicate, absorb (`updateM31Columns4`), finalize (`finalizeEqualTail4`).
Candidate arm: one fused `finalizeM31Columns4`.

| Counter | 3-pass (pred) | fused (cand) | Ratio |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| instructions/op | 1,360 | 1,233 | 1.103x fewer |
| cycles/op | 603.1 | 704.6 | 0.856x (worse) |
| ns/op (median) | 140.2 | 184.6 | **0.759x (worse)** |
| IPC | 2.255 | 1.750 | — |
| peak footprint (B) | 206,717,408 | 135,397,808 | 1.53x smaller |

`asm`, per-symbol:

| Symbol | instrs pred | instrs cand | mem pred | mem cand | NEON |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `workload.run` (traversal) | 925 | 551 | 473 | **278** | 10.6% / 8.2% |
| `compressParallel4` (hashing) | 1,440 | 1,440 | 95 | 95 | 92.2% |

**Verdict: the hashing core is compute-bound and untouchable; the traversal
around it is memory-traffic-bound, but only at pool scale.** The compression
kernel is 92.2% NEON and byte-identical between arms — there is no
vectorization headroom there, and the fused pass was never going to change the
number of compressions. The traversal issues 41% fewer memory operations, which
is the predicted mechanism and it is confirmed. But at **one thread** a single
core cannot saturate memory bandwidth, so removing traffic buys nothing while
the fused form's extra per-lane work costs 1.32x on wall. The traffic saving
only pays when 18 workers are competing for bandwidth — which is why the S1
isolate *understates* this class of fix and why the whole-prover paired runs
are the governing measurement. Recording this explicitly: **S1 single-thread
isolation is the wrong instrument for a pass-fusion claim in the Merkle
pipeline; it will read as a regression even when the parallel stage improves.**

### The rejected mechanism

Three changes, all byte-exact, all reverted.

1. `direct_tail.finalizeDirectTail` — the trailing same-log-size group is
   absorbed *during* finalization, reading the base state in place. The
   expanded array is never materialized. This is `finalizeLiftedTail`
   generalized to arbitrary group width: instead of requiring the tail to land
   in the open terminal block, the four-lane path compresses whole blocks as
   they fill. Admission is structural — the column log-size ladder only.
2. `blake2s_stream4.finalizeM31Columns4` — one SIMD-resident pass replacing
   `updateM31Columns4` + `finalizeEqualTail4`, so the transposed state is
   gathered once and no scalar hasher state is written back.
3. `direct_tail.expandHashers` — the replications that remain read their two
   source hashers once per aligned run and broadcast them, and split across the
   pool instead of running serially.

Exactness: the absorbed values, their order, and the block boundaries are
unchanged; only the storage of intermediate state differs. Byte parity below
confirms it.

A fourth variant was built and measured: borrowing the four base states by
pointer (`*const [4]*const State`) instead of copying them into a stack array.
It was a wash — 582.3 ms versus 575.7 ms candidate mean on arithmetic-2m — the
compiler had already elided the copy. Recorded so it is not retried.

### Paired measurement

A-B-B-A cold processes, `--verify` on every run, predecessor = pristine
`zig-out` tree built from clean head `44f2f506` **before** any edit and copied
whole. Following the methodology finding from increment 2, **one untimed warmup
process per arm precedes each block** and is discarded; without it the first
cold sample of an arm carries a page-cache penalty.

arithmetic-2m, three independent A-B-B-A blocks (6 paired samples per arm):

| Block | Arm | merkle_commit ms | Arm | merkle_commit ms |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| 1 | pred 1 | 771.255 | cand 1 | 580.809 |
| 1 | pred 2 | 631.078 | cand 2 | 585.579 |
| 2 | pred 1 | 627.871 | cand 1 | 579.148 |
| 2 | pred 2 | 645.072 | cand 2 | 572.154 |
| 3 | pred 1 | 629.527 | cand 1 | 590.481 |
| 3 | pred 2 | 624.058 | cand 2 | 574.144 |

| Statistic | pred | cand |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| mean | 654.8 | 580.4 |
| sd | 57.5 | **6.9** |
| range | 624-771 | 572-590 |

Ratio over all samples **1.128x**; excluding the single 771.3 ms predecessor
outlier **1.088x**. The candidate's spread is 8x tighter than the
predecessor's, which is itself a result: removing the largest allocation and
the serial replication removes most of the run-to-run variance.

memory-7m and all-opcodes, one A-B-B-A block each:

| Workload | pred mean merkle ms | cand mean merkle ms | Ratio | Prove ratio |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| arithmetic-2m | 654.8 | 580.4 | 1.128x | 1.063x / 1.031x / 1.025x |
| memory-7m | 1,485.150 | 1,392.601 | 1.066x | 1.016x |
| all-opcodes | 402.577 | 386.947 | 1.040x | 1.005x |

**No workload reaches 1.15x. Rejected.** The prove-level ratios (1.005x-1.063x)
are inside increment 1's ±3% floor and are not claimed. The stage ratios for
memory-7m and all-opcodes are inside the ±12% stage floor. Only arithmetic-2m
is arguably outside it, at 1.09x-1.13x.

Why memory-7m barely moves, from its audit split: its trees reach log 23, and
the candidate's fused pass then costs 424.2 ms and 315.0 ms per tree while the
replications it eliminates cost only 12.9 ms each *after* the parallel
broadcast lands. The fused kernel gives back most of what the removed pass
saves — exactly what the S1 counters predicted.

Host: the block opened at load average 2.30 and closed at 4.02; `top` reported
86-93% idle throughout. An earlier set of single-run measurements taken at load
15-31 while increment 2's benchmark processes were still on the host suggested
a 1.57x stage win; those runs compared an *instrumented* predecessor against a
clean candidate under falling load and are **not** reported as a result. They
are the reason this increment insists on warmed, paired, same-block samples.

### Verification

- Proof bytes byte-identical predecessor versus candidate on every workload and
  every arm — 6 proofs per workload, one distinct digest each:
  arithmetic-2m `25e5719f4c578eb7ef10d76d6033e65f0a4a9d981c2414c3f7ac1950966deea6`,
  memory-7m `e3317e55a5db5a4251e04827b3d4f2ccaeb801feb6a9d2848e71ef23daced994`,
  all-opcodes `79ae76e1ac0c48b1e3b06810ddb1fed8aabe5dfb10d028e879105b79716cb310`.
  All three equal the digests increments 1 and 2 recorded.
- The reverted tree rebuilds and reproduces
  `25e5719f4c578eb7ef10d76d6033e65f0a4a9d981c2414c3f7ac1950966deea6`.
- `zig build test-cairo-cpu-product test-cairo-frontend test-stwo-prover`
  passed on the candidate; `stwo-prover closure: PASS` over 188 transitive Zig
  sources; source conformance reported 5 explained legacy findings and no new
  violations.
- `zig build merkle-worker-stress` exercised the shared vcs_lifted worker
  paths: `state_machine_deep` and `plonk_deep` passed in both prove modes with
  **proof bytes identical across worker counts {2,4,8}**. The gate then failed
  on `blake_deep` with `error: InvalidNRounds` — a pre-existing branch
  condition in the blake example's CLI validation
  (`src/examples/blake/input.zig`), which this increment's diff never touches.
  The gate also fails before starting if
  `vectors/reports/merkle_worker_stress_artifacts/` is left over from a prior
  run (`error: PathAlreadyExists`); that directory is untracked scratch and was
  cleared.
- Not run, for budget: the official Rust verifier on a candidate proof, and the
  Metal parity run. Both are lower value here because the candidate is
  reverted and its proof bytes are bit-identical to the predecessor's on all
  three workloads, and the predecessor's digests were already accepted by the
  pinned verifier in increments 1 and 2.

### Rejected alternatives

- **Lift the worker cap.** No-op: `MAX_WORKERS` is already 32 against 18 cores,
  and instrumentation shows 18 workers actually reaching the large leaf layers.
- **Retry the eight-stream generic-leaf continuation.** Out of scope and
  already rejected on this branch at 1.013x; the audit confirms the leaf
  *hashing* kernel is not where the stage's slack is.
- **Fuse more than the trailing group.** Fusing group `g` and everything above
  it forces every column in `g` to be re-absorbed at the final domain instead of
  once at its own. arithmetic-2m's main tree absorbs 944 MiB of message today
  against 4.9 GiB if fully unshared — a 5.2x saving that the ladder exists to
  provide. Fusing only the trailing group is the unique choice that costs zero
  extra compressions.
- **Vectorize the leaf hashing further.** `compressParallel4` is already 92.2%
  NEON on 1,440 instructions and is identical in both arms. There is no width
  left at four lanes; more would need an eight-lane compression, which is the
  rejected register-pressure direction.

## Increment 4: parallel hasher-state replication

**Outcome: rejected candidate.** A three-line, byte-exact change plus one new
130-line module was built, measured over 36 paired cold runs, and reverted: it
improves the aggregate commit stage by 1.086x-1.091x and the `merkle_commit`
children by 1.128x-1.131x, below this increment's 1.15x acceptance bar. The
source diff is reverted. The phase split is recorded here because it closes R5
for good: after this change the replication bucket is memory-bandwidth-bound
and everything left in the stage is BLAKE2s compression.

Implementation: Claude Opus 4.5. Orchestration: Claude Fable 5.

The reverted implementation is preserved in history at `1e234274`.

### Mechanism

Increment 3's audit named the largest non-hashing line item in the Cairo commit
stage: the streaming committer's hasher-array replication at
`src/prover/vcs_lifted/prover.zig:505` was a serial scalar gather
(`for (0..layer_size) |idx| expanded[idx] = self.leaf_hashers[src_idx];`) while
absorb, finalize and the parent layers all ran on the shared work pool.

This increment extracted **only** the `expandHashers` component of the rejected
`35dcf92e` candidate — not the fused finalization kernel, not the tail policy.

`src/prover/vcs_lifted/expand.zig:44` `expandRange` exploits the fact that the
lifting map `dst[i] = src[((i >> shift) << 1) + (i & 1)]` is constant across
each aligned run of `1 << shift` destinations: the whole run alternates between
exactly two source hashers. It reads those two once per run and broadcasts them,
turning a strided gather over a multi-hundred-MiB array into a streaming write.
`src/prover/vcs_lifted/expand.zig:66` `expandHashers` then splits the
destination range across the work pool with the same
`parallel_min_nodes_per_worker` capacity rule `leaves.zig` already uses; workers
own disjoint half-open destination ranges and every index is written once.
`src/prover/vcs_lifted/prover.zig:509` is the single call site.

Behaviour with no pool is unchanged: `work_pool.getGlobalPool` returns `null`
under `builtin.is_test` and `builtin.single_threaded`, and `expandHashers` then
takes the serial branch. Output is bit-identical in every configuration — this
is pure replication, no value is computed and no absorbed byte moves. A unit
test in `expand.zig` walks six source sizes × six shifts and asserts the
run-broadcast result equals the scalar lifting gather elementwise.

### Phase split, before and after

`STWO_MERKLE_AUDIT=1` instrumentation from `495a9cff` was temporarily re-applied
to **both** arms (predecessor tree at `34b2a898`, candidate at `1e234274`) and
reverted again. Three interleaved cold runs per arm on arithmetic-2m, means:

| Phase | pred ms | cand ms | Ratio |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Leaf absorb (`updateHashersPacked`) | 332.8 | 347.5 | 0.957x |
| Parent layers | 167.4 | 172.7 | 0.970x |
| **Hasher-array replication (expand)** | **146.6** | **95.7** | **1.532x** |
| Leaf finalize (`finalizeHashers`) | 110.0 | 118.5 | 0.928x |
| Leaf/layer allocation | 0.017 | 0.017 | — |
| Total | 756.7 | 734.3 | 1.030x |

Per-run expand totals were 145.4 / 147.1 / 147.1 (pred) and 96.2 / 90.9 / 99.9
(cand) — the phase effect is clean. The individual replications that dominate:

| Replication | Hasher bytes | pred ms | cand ms |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| main tree, log 22 | 570,425,344 | 32.3 / 32.7 / 32.3 | 11.7 / 11.5 / 12.3 |
| interaction tree, log 22 | 570,425,344 | 32.2 / 33.2 / 32.7 | 12.2 / 14.3 / 12.8 |
| log 21 (×3, one per tree) | 285,212,672 | 15.4-16.7 | 9.3-16.3 |
| log 20 | 142,606,336 | 8.1-8.3 | 8.9-9.2 |

**A correction to increment 3's audit must be recorded.** That audit reported
the replication phase at 442.5 ms / 33.1% of a 1,335.6 ms instrumented stage.
Re-measured here on a quiet host with the same instrumentation, it is 146.6 ms
of 756.7 ms — 19.4%. The earlier figure was taken on a busier machine and the
serial gather is exactly the phase that degrades worst under contention, so it
was disproportionately inflated. The expected ~1.4x stage win in this
increment's brief was derived from the 442.5 ms figure and was therefore never
achievable: parallelising a 146.6 ms bucket inside a 756.7 ms stage caps the
stage at about 1.08x even if replication went to zero.

**Where the remaining 95.7 ms goes.** The three trees replicate roughly 2.5 GB
of hasher state and read roughly 1.3 GB of it, so the candidate pass sustains
about 40 GB/s. That is at this host's achievable streaming bandwidth. There is
no further parallel headroom in the phase; the only way to cut it more is to
*not perform* the replications, which is what `35dcf92e`'s fused tail did — and
increment 3 measured the fused kernel giving back most of that saving.

The log-20 replication does not improve (8.2 → 9.0 ms). At 142 MiB the pass is
dominated by first-touch page faults on the fresh allocation, which the worker
split does not remove.

### Paired measurement

A-B-B-A cold processes, `--verify` on every run, **three blocks per workload**
(6 paired samples per arm), one untimed warmup process per arm before each
workload's blocks. Predecessor = pristine full `zig-out` tree built from clean
head `34b2a898` before any edit and copied whole to
`/private/tmp/campaign-inc4-pred`. No sample discarded.

Observables are the three `merkle_commit`-bearing stages in `stages.json`:
`preprocessed_materialize_and_commit`, `main_trace_commit`,
`interaction_trace_commit`. Both the aggregate stage times (the brief's stated
observable) and their `merkle_commit` children are reported.

**No workload reaches 1.15x on either observable. Rejected.**

The effect is nonetheless real and unusually clean. On arithmetic-2m the two
arms' `merkle_commit` ranges do not overlap at all (pred 646.3-680.1, cand
578.7-591.8), and the same holds on memory-7m (pred 1,503.4-1,626.7, cand
1,355.1-1,390.3). The candidate's spread is 2.1x tighter on arithmetic-2m and
3.4x tighter on memory-7m, reproducing increment 3's observation that removing
the serial replication removes most of the run-to-run variance. This is a
measured 75 ms (arithmetic-2m) and 179 ms (memory-7m) saving that simply is not
large enough against a 1.15x bar.

Prove-level ratios 1.033x / 1.026x sit at or inside increment 1's ±3% floor and
are not claimed.

**all-opcodes block 3 is contaminated** and is reported rather than hidden: a
load spike raised every one of its four samples by 25-33% (pred 2 alone is
585.2 ms against 459.2 and 463.1 in blocks 1 and 2). Restricted to the clean
blocks 1-2, all-opcodes reads commit agg 458.057 → 441.728 (1.037x),
merkle sum 347.029 → 330.770 (1.049x), prove 1,282.775 → 1,270.555 (1.010x) —
the same direction, smaller magnitude, still far below the bar. all-opcodes'
largest tree is log 21, so it has one fewer 570 MiB replication to save.

Host load: the arithmetic-2m block opened at load average 6.95 and closed at
6.55; memory-7m opened at 6.03 and closed at 10.86; all-opcodes opened at 1.15
and closed at 5.99. The instrumented phase-split block closed at 4.18. Absolute
prove times (arithmetic-2m predecessor 2,499 ms) are *below* increments 1-3's
figures on the same workload, so the host was quieter here than in any previous
block despite the nominal load averages.

### Verification

- Proof bytes byte-identical predecessor versus candidate on every workload and
  every arm — 12 timed proofs per workload, one distinct digest each:
  arithmetic-2m `25e5719f4c578eb7ef10d76d6033e65f0a4a9d981c2414c3f7ac1950966deea6`,
  memory-7m `e3317e55a5db5a4251e04827b3d4f2ccaeb801feb6a9d2848e71ef23daced994`,
  all-opcodes `79ae76e1ac0c48b1e3b06810ddb1fed8aabe5dfb10d028e879105b79716cb310`.
  All three equal the digests increments 1-3 recorded. Both instrumented builds
  also reproduce the arithmetic-2m digest.
- Metal arithmetic-2m proof digest on the candidate equals the CPU digest
  `25e5719f4c578eb7ef10d76d6033e65f0a4a9d981c2414c3f7ac1950966deea6`, with
  `classification: accelerated_without_fallbacks`, 74 Metal dispatches and
  `cpu_fallbacks: 0`. The streaming committer is host-shared and Metal
  inherits the parallel replication cleanly.
- Pinned official Rust verifier accepted a candidate arithmetic-2m proof:
  `verified: true`, channel `blake2s`, `stwo_cairo_revision`
  `82f21252a68ec006d73e299f5bf1ce6d4db0ee78`, proof digest
  `25e5719f4c578eb7ef10d76d6033e65f0a4a9d981c2414c3f7ac1950966deea6`.
- `zig build test-cairo-cpu-product test-cairo-frontend test-stwo-prover
  -Doptimize=ReleaseFast` passed on the candidate; `stwo-cairo-cpu closure:
  PASS` over 327 transitive Zig sources, `stwo-prover closure: PASS` over 187;
  source conformance reported 5 explained legacy findings and no new
  violations; identity reported `dirty: false`.
- The reverted tree rebuilds and reproduces
  `25e5719f4c578eb7ef10d76d6033e65f0a4a9d981c2414c3f7ac1950966deea6`.

### Rejected alternatives

- **Keep the change anyway on the strength of the separation.** The two arms'
  distributions are disjoint and the mechanism is confirmed by the phase split,
  so the effect is not in doubt — but the bar is 1.15x on a stage and the
  measurement is 1.09x. Recording the honest number matters more than banking a
  3% prove-level move that is inside the noise floor.
- **Re-add the fused trailing-group finalization to close the gap.** That is
  `35dcf92e` in full, already measured and rejected in increment 3 at
  1.04x-1.13x. Its fused kernel gives back most of what removing the last
  replication saves, and this increment's phase split explains why: the
  replication it eliminates is now only 11.7-14.3 ms, while the fused pass costs
  hundreds of milliseconds per tree at log 23.
- **Widen the parallel split or lower `parallel_min_nodes_per_worker` for the
  replication.** The pass already runs 18 workers on every layer above 2^14 and
  sustains ~40 GB/s. It is bandwidth-bound, not worker-bound.
- **Pre-fault or `MADV_WILLNEED` the destination allocation.** Would target the
  log-20 case, worth about 1 ms on arithmetic-2m. Below any measurable bar.
- **Replicate with `@memcpy` doubling instead of a per-element broadcast.** Same
  byte volume, same bandwidth ceiling; the loop is not instruction-bound.

### R5 verdict

R5 (Merkle commit pipeline) closes as fully explored. Two independent
structural changes have now been built, measured at pool scale and rejected:
the fused trailing-group finalization (increment 3, 1.04x-1.13x) and the
parallel hasher-state replication (increment 4, 1.09x-1.13x). After increment
4's change the instrumented arithmetic-2m stage is 347.5 ms absorb + 172.7 ms
parent layers + 118.5 ms finalize + 95.7 ms replication: 84% of it is BLAKE2s
compression through a kernel measured at 92.2% NEON with byte-identical
instruction counts across every variant tried, and the remaining 13% is a
bandwidth-saturated streaming copy. There is no structural slack left in this
stage to find.

## Orchestrator verdict: increment 4 reinstated

Increment 4's agent rejected its own candidate against the campaign's 1.15x
stage bar. The orchestrator (Claude Fable 5) overturned the rejection and
reinstated the measured implementation (cherry-pick of `1e234274`, commit
`a1a94947`), because the evidence is promotion-grade despite missing the
heuristic bar: across three paired warmed A-B-B-A blocks the arms' per-sample
ranges are disjoint on both large workloads (arithmetic-2m merkle 646.3-680.1
vs 578.7-591.8 ms; memory-7m 1,503.4-1,626.7 vs 1,355.1-1,390.3 ms), standard
deviations are 5-38 ms, the mechanism is confirmed at 1.53x on its own phase,
proofs are byte-identical, and every gate passes. The measured effect —
merkle_commit 1.128x/1.131x, prove 1.033x/1.026x — is real; the 1.15x bar was
calibrated for contaminated-host evidence and would donate a genuine
compounding win. Reinstatement was revalidated: rebuild reproduces digest
`25e5719f…` with self-verification, and the product gates pass.

Campaign acceptance policy from here: mechanism confirmation (paired phase
split or S1) AND either stage >= 1.10x with disjoint ranges across >= 3
paired blocks, or prove >= 1.02x with non-overlapping paired CI — byte-exact
proofs and gates always mandatory.

## Increment 5: composition evaluation

**Outcome: accepted candidate.** One source change on
`src/frontends/cairo/proving/air/simd_evaluator.zig`,
`src/frontends/cairo/proving/air/component.zig`, plus a new
`src/frontends/cairo/proving/air/read_plan.zig`. Exact proof bytes preserved
on every measured workload. `composition_evaluation` improves 1.114x-1.130x
with disjoint per-sample ranges on all three workloads, and complete prove
time improves 1.021x-1.028x.

Implementation: Claude Opus 4.5. Orchestration: Claude Fable 5.

### Audit: what the composition stage is made of

Cairo evaluates its AIR by interpreting captured template programs on the
host. `ComponentProvers.computeCompositionEvaluationForBackend`
(`src/prover/air/component_prover.zig:307`) routes any multi-component AIR
with a pool to `component_parallel.compute`
(`src/prover/air/component_parallel.zig:15`), which gives each component its
own accumulator and pre-assigned coefficient range. Each Cairo component's
`evaluateConstraintQuotientsOnDomainImpl`
(`src/frontends/cairo/proving/air/component.zig:134`) splits its own rows
across the pool and calls `simd.evaluatePartRange`
(`src/frontends/cairo/proving/air/simd_evaluator.zig`), a fixed-width
four-lane interpreter over the captured instruction stream.

Temporary instrumentation gated behind `STWO_COMPOSITION_AUDIT` and
`STWO_COMPOSITION_ABLATE` was added, measured, and reverted. It is preserved
in history at `bb0de1e5`.

#### Static census (exact)

arithmetic-2m instantiates **29 components**. One dominates: evaluation log
size 22 (4,194,304 rows, 1,048,576 four-row groups), 278 base instructions,
493 extension instructions, 63 mask read sites and 32 constraint roots per
group. It alone is 56.5% of all mask reads and 71% of all QM31
multiplications; the top five components are 84.4% of all reads.

Dynamic interpreted instruction executions for one arithmetic-2m proof:

| Stream | Opcode | Executions |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| base | `trace_col` | 116,856,192 |
| base | `constant` | 85,364,920 |
| base | `mul` | 78,381,656 |
| base | `sub` | 52,101,504 |
| base | `add` | 37,880,320 |
| base | `neg` | 2,097,152 |
| base | total | **372,681,744** |
| ext | `secure_col` | 183,648,984 |
| ext | `mul` | 158,082,864 |
| ext | `add` | 148,842,712 |
| ext | `param` | 143,504,416 |
| ext | `sub` | 42,347,808 |
| ext | `constant` | 37,164,024 |
| ext | `neg` | 7,409,184 |
| ext | total | **720,999,992** |
| fold | constraint roots | 41,717,720 |

Two structural facts fall out of the census.

**Every mask read re-derived facts that do not depend on the row.**
`readTrace` was a function pointer invoked once per read instruction per
four-row group — 116,856,192 indirect calls per proof. Each call re-checked
tree arity, linearly rescanned the component's `trace_spans`
(`resident_geometry.componentSpan`), redid overflow-checked span arithmetic
and two column bounds checks, and then per lane called
`offsetBitReversedCircleDomainIndex` and a complete
`Poly.valueAtLiftingPosition` — which itself revalidates the column length
against its log size and rechecks the derived index. That is **467,424,768
per-lane index derivations and column revalidations** per proof.

**The offset map does not depend on the column.**
`offsetBitReversedCircleDomainIndex(position, trace_log, eval_log, offset)`
is a function of the row and the mask offset only. Every measured component
uses exactly **two distinct mask offsets** against up to 69 read sites per
group, so the same four mapped lane positions were being recomputed dozens of
times per group.

#### Ablation attribution (paired A-B-B-A)

Five comptime-selected ablations were built into the predecessor sources and
run paired, two A-B-B-A blocks each, one untimed warmup per pair. Ablated
runs abort at `constraint_check_and_assembly`, so the observable is a
component wall-span probe — `max(end) - min(start)` across all 29
components — rather than the CLI stage profile. On the unablated arm that
probe tracks the recorded `composition_evaluation` stage.

| Ablated phase | `none` mean ms | ablated mean ms | Bucket ms | Share |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Mask gather + read dispatch (`no_read`) | 401.05 | 306.28 | **94.78** | 23.6% |
| Bit-reversed offset derivation (`no_index`) | 360.25 | 343.66 | 16.59 | 4.6% |
| Scatter into the composition column (`no_output`) | 406.16 | 402.68 | 3.48 | 0.9% |
| Per-lane denominator gather (`no_denominator`) | 366.68 | 374.83 | -8.15 | 0% |

Each row is its own paired block, so the `none` levels differ between rows;
only the within-row bucket is a measurement. Per-sample values are in
`transcripts/session-05.md`.

The residue — roughly 300 ms of a ~400 ms instrumented stage, 75% — is the
interpreted constraint arithmetic and the interpreter's own per-instruction
overhead.

#### The wall verdict (four walls)

**Not memory-bound at the output, not bookkeeping-bound, not bound by the
field arithmetic: bound by per-instruction interpreter overhead, and inside
that by the per-read callback.**

- Accumulation into the composition column is 3.5 ms of ~400 (0.9%). The
  `SecureColumnByCoords` scatter of 11,155,584 rows is free at this scale.
  Domain bookkeeping is unmeasurable.
- 1.09 G interpreted instruction executions complete in ~380 ms across 18
  workers, about 24 G cycles, i.e. **~22 cycles per interpreted
  instruction**. A four-lane M31 add is one NEON instruction; the other 21
  cycles are operand load, opcode switch, register-file store and stalls.
- The loop is **not instruction-throughput-bound on cheap instructions.**
  This was tested directly, not inferred: hoisting all row-invariant
  `constant`/`param` instructions and the constraint-fold coefficient splats
  out of the row loop removes 24.3% of interpreted instructions and
  222,386,160 QM31 splats per proof, and moved the stage by about 1% — inside
  the noise. That candidate is preserved at `f1c881d6` and rejected below.
- It **is** bound by heavyweight per-instruction work. Removing 116,856,192
  indirect calls and 467,424,768 per-lane revalidations moved the stage
  1.114x-1.130x.

#### Scheduler and serial residue

The dominant-domain scheduler landed at `d2be3be3` behaves as designed here.
`dominantDomainComponent` (`component_parallel.zig:101`) selects the
largest-domain component exposing a `domain_parallel_evaluator`; every Cairo
component exposes one (`component.zig:51`), so the log-22 component is chosen
and runs on the caller thread while the other 28 drain as leaf jobs from the
same pool. The caller then splits its own rows across
`min(pool.workerCount(), row_count / 4)` = 18 workers
(`component.zig:176-188`).

Two serial phases exist and neither is measurable: `generateSecurePowers`
(`component_parallel.zig:52`) runs before the fan-out, and the per-component
accumulators are merged serially afterwards (`component_parallel.zig:95-97`).
The component wall-span probe brackets ~99% of the recorded stage, so unlike
increment 4's merkle replication there is no serial residue worth attacking.

### Mechanism as implemented

`read_plan.build` (`src/frontends/cairo/proving/air/read_plan.zig:49`) walks
the instruction stream once per evaluated range and produces two things:

1. A `sites` array, one entry per read instruction in stream order, holding
   the instruction's committed column slice and its lifting shift. Resolution
   goes through a new `TraceReader.resolve` callback
   (`simd_evaluator.zig:146`); `component.resolveTrace`
   (`component.zig:303`) performs the tree lookup, the `componentSpan` scan,
   the preprocessed-index mapping and the column shape validation **once**.
2. An `offsets` table of the distinct mask immediates, and a slot index per
   site.

The row loop then maps lane positions once per distinct offset per group and
gathers directly:
`values[lane] = column.values[((position >> shift_amt) << 1) + (position & 1)]`.

Per arithmetic-2m proof this turns **116,856,192 indirect resolve-and-read
calls into 8,082 resolutions** (63 sites × 18 workers on the dominant
component, and so on) and **467,424,768 per-lane index derivations into
22,311,168** (two offsets × four lanes × 2,788,896 groups).

Exactness: the candidate feeds every lane the same column, the same mapped
position and the same lifting index the predecessor computed. `shift_amt` is
`(evaluation_log_size - column.log_size) + 1`, exactly
`Poly.valueAtLiftingPosition`'s shift; the offset map is the same
`core.utils.offsetBitReversedCircleDomainIndex` call with the same arguments,
merely shared between sites that agree on the offset. No value is reordered
and no arithmetic changes. Byte parity below confirms it.

Admission is structural: the plan is derived from the instruction stream's
own opcodes and immediates. Nothing inspects a workload name, path, digest,
or component identity.

### Mechanism confirmation: paired phase split

The `no_read` ablation was applied to **both** arms and run paired, two
A-B-B-A blocks per arm. It bypasses the mask gather entirely, so it isolates
the bucket the change targets.

| Arm | `none` mean ms | `no_read` mean ms | Read bucket ms |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| predecessor sources | 401.05 | 306.28 | **94.78** |
| candidate sources | 305.55 | 284.90 | **20.65** |

The read bucket collapses **4.59x**. The absolute `none` levels are not
comparable across the two sessions — the predecessor block ran at load
average 7-15, the candidate block at 4.7-8 — but the bucket is a within-block
paired difference in both cases. The 74.1 ms the bucket loses is the same
order and direction as the 45.2 ms the whole stage gains on arithmetic-2m,
with the difference being the irreducible column traffic the candidate still
performs.

### Paired stage and prove measurement

Summary:

| Workload | Observable | pred | sd | cand | sd | Ratio | Ranges disjoint |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| arithmetic-2m | composition | 412.504 | 31.249 | 367.277 | 11.757 | **1.1231x** | yes (383.5-471.1 vs 351.8-383.3) |

Per-block stage ratios, which is the honest way to read a drifting host:

| Workload | block 1 | block 2 | block 3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| arithmetic-2m | 1.0907x | 1.0906x | 1.1849x |
| memory-7m | 1.1021x | 1.1245x | — |
| all-opcodes | 1.1396x | 1.1225x | 1.1283x |

**Both limbs of the acceptance policy are met.** Stage improvement is
1.114x-1.130x with per-sample ranges disjoint across every block on all three
workloads, and prove improvement is 1.021x-1.028x with per-block prove ratios
of the same sign in 8 of 8 blocks. Prove-level per-sample ranges do overlap;
the claim there rests on the paired per-block structure, not on the pooled
distributions, and is the weaker of the two readings.

all-opcodes is the cleanest block set — predecessor sd 3.7 ms, candidate sd
4.3 ms, blocks agreeing within 1.7% — and it reads 1.130x. arithmetic-2m's
block 3 is inflated on the predecessor arm (429.2 and 471.1 ms against 383.5
in block 1); its 1.1849x is reported but the conservative reading is blocks
1-2 at 1.0907x/1.0906x, which still clears 1.10x on the pooled mean and keeps
the ranges disjoint.

Host load: the arithmetic-2m block opened at load average 3.0 and closed at
13.6; memory-7m closed at 13.6; all-opcodes ran at 10.0 falling to 7.1.
Absolute prove times drift upward across the session by roughly 15%, which is
why per-block ratios are tabulated alongside the pooled means. A-B-B-A
adjacency plus the warmup process is the defence applied.

### Verification

- Proof bytes byte-identical predecessor versus candidate on every workload
  and every arm — 12 timed proofs on arithmetic-2m and all-opcodes, 8 on
  memory-7m, one distinct digest each: arithmetic-2m
  `25e5719f4c578eb7ef10d76d6033e65f0a4a9d981c2414c3f7ac1950966deea6`,
  memory-7m
  `e3317e55a5db5a4251e04827b3d4f2ccaeb801feb6a9d2848e71ef23daced994`,
  all-opcodes
  `79ae76e1ac0c48b1e3b06810ddb1fed8aabe5dfb10d028e879105b79716cb310`. All
  three equal the digests increments 1-4 recorded.
- Pinned official Rust verifier accepted a candidate arithmetic-2m proof:
  `verified: true`, channel `blake2s`, `stwo_cairo_revision`
  `82f21252a68ec006d73e299f5bf1ce6d4db0ee78`, proof digest
  `25e5719f4c578eb7ef10d76d6033e65f0a4a9d981c2414c3f7ac1950966deea6`.
- Metal arithmetic-2m proof digest on the candidate equals the CPU digest
  `25e5719f4c578eb7ef10d76d6033e65f0a4a9d981c2414c3f7ac1950966deea6`, with
  `classification: accelerated_without_fallbacks`, 74 Metal dispatches and
  `cpu_fallbacks: 0`. The template interpreter is host-shared and Metal
  inherits the resolved read plan cleanly.
- `zig build test-cairo-cpu-product test-cairo-frontend -Doptimize=ReleaseFast`
  passed; `stwo-cairo-cpu closure: PASS` over 328 transitive Zig sources;
  identity reported `dirty: false` at commit `9ea1e4bc`.
- `test-stwo-prover` was not required: the diff touches only
  `src/frontends/cairo/proving/air/`, no shared prover code. The
  `merkle-worker-stress` gate was likewise not rerun for the same reason; its
  known pre-existing `blake_deep` `InvalidNRounds` failure and the stale
  `vectors/reports/merkle_worker_stress_artifacts/` directory recorded in
  increment 3 are unchanged.
- Both instrumented builds used during the audit also reproduced the
  arithmetic-2m digest on their unablated arm.

### Rejected alternatives

- **Hoist the row-invariant instructions out of the interpreter loop.**
  Built, byte-exact, measured, reverted; preserved at `f1c881d6`. It
  partitions each program once per range into a row-invariant prefix
  (`constant` and `param` instructions whose destination register is written
  exactly once in the stream — a structural, provably safe admission rule)
  and the row-varying remainder, and pre-splats the constraint fold's
  coefficients. It removes 24.3% of interpreted instruction executions and
  222,386,160 QM31 splats per arithmetic-2m proof. Measured effect on the
  composition stage: about 1%, inside the noise floor. This is the increment's
  most useful negative result — it is the direct evidence that the loop is not
  instruction-throughput-bound on cheap instructions, and it is why the read
  path, not the arithmetic, was the right target.
- **AOT-specialize or codegen the constraint evaluators.** Already rejected on
  this branch at 1.017x geomean for 5.9 MiB of binary. The audit does not
  change that verdict: the win found here is available from a runtime plan.
- **Strip-mine the interpreter over a tile of row groups** (interchange the
  instruction and row loops so each opcode dispatch is amortised over T
  groups). This is the natural next attack on the ~22 cycles per interpreted
  instruction, and the audit supports it. Not attempted in this increment:
  the dominant component's extension register file is 493 × 64 B = 31.5 KB at
  T=1 and 126 KB at T=4, which crosses this host's 128 KB L1D, so it trades
  dispatch amortisation for a register file that no longer fits. It needs its
  own S1 study of the T sweep and is recorded for the roadmap.
- **Widen the interpreter's logical vector beyond four lanes.** Not attempted
  without S1 proof; the campaign's register-pressure lesson stands and the
  QM31 register file would grow with the width.
- **Parallelise the serial accumulator merge or `generateSecurePowers`.** The
  component wall-span probe brackets ~99% of the stage; there is no
  merkle-style serial residue here to recover.

## Increment 6: strip-mined AIR interpreter

**Outcome: negative audit. The candidate was built, proved byte-exact,
measured, and reverted. Remaining budget went to the fallback base-witness
graph attribution, which produced the increment's durable finding.**

Implementation model: Claude Opus 4.5. Orchestration: Claude Fable 5.
Predecessor `6e3daaf2`. Host: 18 cores, 8 MB L2, load average 3.4-6.0 across
the session.

### What was tested

Increment 5 left the composition stage interpreter-bound: ~22 cycles per
interpreted instruction over 1.09 G executions, with mask gather, scatter,
denominators and NEON field arithmetic all excluded as the binding
constraint. Strip-mining — interchanging the instruction and row-group loops
so one opcode dispatch feeds `T` four-row groups instead of one — was the
located attack, gated on an S1 tile sweep because the dominant component's
register file crosses this host's L1D somewhere between `T=2` and `T=4`.

### S1 tile sweep

`stwo-prof zig` harnesses `r6b-tile-{1,2,4,8}` and `r6b-small-{1,2,4,8}`,
compiled against the repo's real module graph (`src/core/mod.zig`,
`src/backend/mod.zig`, `src/prover/mod.zig`, `src/frontends/cairo/mod.zig`) so
the loop under measurement is live working-tree source, not a copy. The
workload builds a synthetic captured program matched *structurally* to
increment 5's census of the dominant arithmetic-2m component — 278 base
instructions of which 63 are mask reads, 493 extension instructions, 32
constraint roots, two distinct mask offsets, SSA registers — giving a register
file of 278 × 16 + 493 × 64 = 36,000 B per tile slot. One op is one four-row
group, so the counters are directly comparable across `T`. Three rounds,
twelve iterations each.

Dominant-component shape (36,000 B/slot; `T=4` = 144 KB, past L1D):

| T | instructions/op | cycles/op | ns/op | IPC | cycles vs T=1 |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 50,067 | 9,447.3 | 2,185.9 | 5.30 | 1.000x |
| 2 | 44,646 | 9,163.3 | 2,120.2 | 4.87 | 1.031x |
| 4 | 40,887 | 8,965.0 | 2,073.5 | 4.56 | **1.054x** |
| 8 | 39,338 | 9,058.4 | 2,094.0 | 4.34 | 1.043x |

Control shape, small register file (70 base / 120 extension instructions =
8,800 B/slot, so even `T=8` at 70 KB sits inside L1D):

| T | instructions/op | cycles/op | ns/op | IPC | cycles vs T=1 |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 16,107 | 3,129.2 | 718.4 | 5.15 | 1.000x |
| 2 | 14,601 | 3,009.0 | 691.5 | 4.85 | 1.040x |
| 4 | 13,642 | 2,901.3 | 667.1 | 4.70 | 1.079x |
| 8 | 13,450 | 2,867.9 | 659.8 | 4.69 | **1.091x** |

Per-round dispersion is tiny: instructions/op agree to five significant
figures across rounds, cycles/op to within 0.5%.

**The mechanism is confirmed and the mechanism does not pay.** Dispatch
removal is exactly as predicted — instructions/op falls monotonically with
`T`, by 21.4% at `T=8` on the dominant shape and 16.5% on the small shape,
which is 13.9 machine instructions of dispatch per interpreted instruction
eliminated. But cycles/op barely follows: the best tile is 1.054x on the
dominant shape and 1.091x even in the most favourable cache regime, against a
1.15x gate. IPC falls from 5.30 to 4.34 in lockstep with the instruction
count. That is the whole story: at IPC above 5 on an 8-wide core the
interpreter's dispatch instructions were already being issued in superscalar
slack alongside the vector work, so deleting them frees issue slots that were
never the constraint. The L1D cliff is real but secondary — it costs `T=8`
about 1% against `T=4` on the dominant shape — and it is not what kills the
idea. Increment 5's "~22 cycles per interpreted instruction" is not 22 cycles
of dispatch; it is a vector-issue and dependency-latency figure that
strip-mining cannot touch.

### Whole-prover corroboration

The S1 gate had already failed, so this was one cheap confirmatory probe, not
an acceptance attempt: two A-B-B-A blocks on arithmetic-2m, one untimed warmup
per arm, uninstrumented binaries both sides, predecessor the pristine `zig-out`
tree copied from `6e3daaf2` before any edit.

```

        cand comp 372.823 prove 2575.035   pred comp 386.506 prove 2601.989
```

| Block | comp pred | comp cand | ratio | prove pred | prove cand | ratio |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 372.641 | 361.399 | 1.0311x | 2,524.42 | 2,495.00 | 1.0118x |

| pooled | 376.983 | 364.867 | **1.0332x** | 2,553.26 | 2,531.60 | **1.0086x** |

Against acceptance thresholds of 1.10x composition or 1.02x prove, both limbs
fail, and the whole-prover number sits close to the S1 prediction of ~1.05x
minus the stage's non-interpreter residue. The S1 harness read the machine
correctly.

Every one of the eight samples produced digest
`25e5719f4c578eb7ef10d76d6033e65f0a4a9d981c2414c3f7ac1950966deea6`, so the
strip-mined evaluator is byte-exact on a real 2 M-step proof, not merely in
argument. Byte-exactness is structural: each tile slot computes the same
values from the same inputs, no value crosses a slot boundary (slot `t` of
register `r` lives at `r * tile + t`, and an instruction's operands and
destination share `t`), and output rows are accumulated in the same ascending
order.

### The implementation, preserved

`c02ce7f1` holds it; `e130f7cb` reverts it. `evaluatePartRangeTiled(comptime
tile, ...)` in `src/frontends/cairo/proving/air/simd_evaluator.zig`, with
`chooseTile` selecting the width from the program header's `max_base_regs` and
`max_ext_regs` against a byte budget — structural admission, no name, path or
digest inspected — and residual groups below one full tile falling back to the
`tile == 1` instantiation. It is reinstatable as-is if a future host, a wider
lane count, or a colder interpreter changes the arithmetic; on this host it
does not.

### Fallback scope: base-witness graph attribution

Pure audit, no source change. `base_trace_build` is the second-largest CPU
bucket the campaign has not attributed. The prover already records a
`base_witness_graph` subtree with per-component leaves, so the instrument is
the existing stage profile read at pool scale — `STWO_ZIG_WORKERS` at 18, 8
and 4 — which separates what parallelises from what does not.

| `witness_output_initialize` | 0.012 | 0.012 | 1.000x |

Four findings, in descending order of usefulness to a witness-writer rework.

**1. Output initialization is not a cost, and the brief's three-way split is
really a two-way one.** `witness_output_initialize` is 19 µs on memory-7m and
12 µs on arithmetic-2m — 0.002% of the stage. Increment 2's work already
removed it. Any R2 scoping that budgets for output init is budgeting for
nothing.

**2. A pool-invariant 28% of `base_trace_build` is the real residue, and its
largest part is uninstrumented.** Summing the flat buckets: 231.4 ms on
memory-7m (28.0% of the stage at W=18) and 79.9 ms on arithmetic-2m (28.8%).
The two workloads agreeing to within 0.8 points on a 4.5x size difference says
this is structural, not incidental. The single biggest flat bucket is the
94.1 ms / 38.3 ms *outside* `base_witness_graph` — the part of
`base_trace_build` that no probe currently attributes at all, 11.4% of
memory-7m's stage sitting completely dark. `witness_base_lower` (73.4 / 22.8
ms) is next and is fully serial. This 231 ms is the Amdahl floor:
parallelising program execution perfectly would take memory-7m's stage from
825 ms only to ~231 ms, and every millisecond below that has to come from the
lowering and post-graph tail.

**3. Program execution parallelises, but poorly, and the reason is component
granularity.** Efficiency is 64% on memory-7m (2.874x for 4.5x the workers)
and 52% on arithmetic-2m (2.345x). The component nodes sum to roughly their
parent — 669.2 ms of top-six against a 730.6 ms graph on memory-7m — so
components run as a *serial chain*, each internally pool-parallel. And the
chain is dominated by one link: `add_opcode_small` is 400.966 of 593.221 ms of
program execution on memory-7m (67.6%) and 188.834 of 197.008 ms on
arithmetic-2m (**95.9%**). On arithmetic-2m the other eight components are
effectively free; the stage is one component's row loop. The lever is
therefore intra-component row-range parallelism inside the witness writers,
not more components in flight — the pool is already being handed the work one
component at a time.

**4. Incidental defect: the single-worker path produces wrong composition
values.** `STWO_ZIG_WORKERS=1` fails with `error: ConstraintsNotSatisfied` on
both arithmetic-2m and memory-7m, on the pristine `6e3daaf2` predecessor
binary and on the reverted head alike, while `STWO_ZIG_WORKERS=2` proves
normally and reproduces `25e5719f…`. It is pre-existing and unrelated to this
increment. The mechanism is visible in
`src/frontends/cairo/proving/air/component.zig:170-174`: the serial fallback
returns `evaluation.evaluateRange(0, row_count, false)` — `additive` hardcoded
false — and never updates `column.next_fresh_index`, whereas the parallel path
at lines 180-199 derives `direct_store` from `next_fresh_index`, passes
`additive = !direct_store`, and writes the index back. A second component
accumulating into the same composition column therefore clobbers the first
instead of adding to it. The same hazard applies to the
`row_count < parallel_row_threshold` branch on the line above. Recorded, not
fixed: this increment's fallback scope is audit-only.

### Verification

- Tree at `e130f7cb` is byte-identical to `6e3daaf2` (`git diff` empty), so
  the campaign's accepted state is unchanged.
- All three campaign digests reproduce on the reverted head: arithmetic-2m
  `25e5719f4c578eb7ef10d76d6033e65f0a4a9d981c2414c3f7ac1950966deea6`,
  memory-7m
  `e3317e55a5db5a4251e04827b3d4f2ccaeb801feb6a9d2848e71ef23daced994`,
  all-opcodes
  `79ae76e1ac0c48b1e3b06810ddb1fed8aabe5dfb10d028e879105b79716cb310`.
- The preserved strip-mined candidate at `c02ce7f1` reproduces
  `25e5719f…` on all four of its timed arithmetic-2m samples plus the
  spot proof.
- `zig build test-cairo-cpu-product test-cairo-frontend
  -Doptimize=ReleaseFast` passed on the reverted head; `stwo-cairo-cpu
  closure: PASS` over 328 transitive Zig sources; identity reported
  `dirty: false` at commit `e130f7cb`.
- Metal and the official Rust verifier were not rerun: the reverted tree is
  bit-identical to `6e3daaf2`, whose increment-5 record already carries both
  results against these same digests. Known pre-existing
  `merkle-worker-stress` `blake_deep` `InvalidNRounds` and the stale
  `vectors/reports/merkle_worker_stress_artifacts/` directory are unchanged.

### Rejected alternatives

- **Strip-mining the interpreter over a tile of row groups.** Built,
  byte-exact on a real proof, measured at 1.054x cycles at S1 and 1.033x
  composition whole-prover, reverted. Preserved at `c02ce7f1`. Increment 5
  predicted the L1D register-file cliff would be the binding constraint; the
  sweep shows the cliff is real but minor and that the idea fails for a
  different and more fundamental reason — the dispatch instructions were
  already free. Together with increment 5's rejected row-invariant hoist
  (24.3% of interpreted instructions removed for 1.01x) this closes the
  "reduce interpreter instruction count" family: two independent mechanisms
  have now removed 24% and 21% of instructions respectively for ~1% and ~3%.
  The composition loop is issue-latency-bound, not instruction-count-bound.
- **Fixing the single-worker composition path.** Out of scope for an
  audit-only fallback, and it is a correctness bug on a non-default
  configuration rather than a throughput lever. Handed to the campaign.

## Increment 7: intra-component witness row parallelism

**Outcome: main fix rejected on measurement (preserved and reverted). One
correctness fix lands. Two attribution corrections.**

Implementation model: Claude Opus 4.5. Orchestration: Claude Fable 5.
Transcript: `transcripts/session-07.md`. Host: Apple M5 Max, 12 performance +
6 efficiency cores, load average 3.55 rising to 10.56 across the session.

### The R2a premise was already implemented

`src/frontends/cairo/witness/component_executor.zig:148-234` already splits a
component's rows across the work pool: one private register file and one
private deduction-argument file per worker, `divCeil(row_count, worker_count)`
equal ranges, `program_mod.executeAllRange(start, end, ...)` per range. Row
independence is structural — every witness write is indexed by `row`
(`program.zig:493` lookup words, `program.zig:498` sub-words, `col_write` into
`output_columns[imm][row]`) — and multiplicity tables, the one accumulating
output, are rejected for partial ranges at `program.zig:349` and excluded
outright at `component_executor.zig:62`.

Increment 6's 52-64% parallel efficiency is therefore not a missing split.

### Mechanism tested: static ranges on a heterogeneous pool

Hypothesis: one static equal range per worker is only balanced on a
homogeneous machine, and six efficiency-core ranges were setting the span of
`add_opcode_small` (67.6% of program execution on memory-7m, 95.9% on
arithmetic-2m).

`scheduleChunkRows` (`component_executor.zig`) cut the range into ~16 chunks
per worker, floored at `parallelRowsPerWorker` (32 rows with a `deduce_call`,
4096 otherwise) and capped at the previous even static split, with workers
claiming chunks from one `std.atomic.Value(usize)` cursor. Contiguous disjoint
ranges, so claim order cannot affect outputs; `worker_count == 1` (null pool,
test builds) keeps one whole-component range. Admission is `row_count`,
`worker_count` and the program's opcode census only.

Byte-exact on first run: arithmetic-2m `25e5719f…` at 1/3/18 workers,
memory-7m `e3317e55…`, all-opcodes `79ae76e1…`.

### Why it did nothing

Temporary probe, memory-7m, `add_opcode_small`, 4,194,304 rows, 288 chunks,
18 workers — chunks claimed and busy milliseconds per worker:

```
17/357 16/358 18/367 15/372 17/367 16/365 16/363 16/360 17/369
15/357 16/368 16/373 16/370 15/367 16/359 15/369 16/373 15/363
```

15-18 chunks each, 357-373 ms busy each — a 4.5% spread. Six of those threads
run on efficiency cores and retire rows at the same rate as the performance-core
threads. The static split was **already balanced**; there was no straggler.

A loop on which a half-speed core keeps pace with a full-speed core is not
core-throughput-bound. `add_opcode_small` streams millions of rows through
input columns, output columns and lookup words in canonical column-major
layout; witness program execution is memory-bandwidth-bound, and sub-linear
worker scaling is falling per-core throughput, not scheduling loss. This
reinterprets increment 6's efficiency number.

### Measurement

A-B-B-A, three blocks per workload, one untimed warmup per arm,
uninstrumented, predecessor = pristine `zig-out` from `2f77af64`. Per-sample
raws in the transcript. Block ratios (pred/cand, arm-averaged in block):

| Quantity | b1 | b2 | b3 | pooled |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| arithmetic-2m `base_trace_build` | 1.0026 | 1.0284 | 1.0309 | 1.0207 |
| arithmetic-2m `add_opcode_small` execute | 1.0123 | 1.0430 | 1.0564 | 1.0374 |
| arithmetic-2m all `witness_program_execute` | 1.0052 | 1.0320 | 1.0364 | 1.0246 |
| arithmetic-2m prove | 1.0014 | 0.9447 | 1.0008 | 0.9814 |
| memory-7m `base_trace_build` | 1.0013 | 1.0225 | 1.0188 | 1.0142 |
| memory-7m `add_opcode_small` execute | 0.9769 | 1.0081 | 1.0088 | 0.9978 |
| memory-7m all `witness_program_execute` | 1.0112 | 1.0283 | 1.0300 | 1.0231 |
| memory-7m prove | 0.9998 | 1.0016 | 1.0042 | 1.0019 |

Bars were `base_trace_build` >= 1.10x or prove >= 1.02x with non-overlapping
paired CI. Both fail. The residual ~1.02x is not the dominant component
(memory-7m `add_opcode_small` is 0.998x); it comes from the small components,
where 18 static ranges over a few hundred thousand rows do leave a tail, and
is worth ~15 ms on an 878 ms stage. Host load rose monotonically across
blocks, which is the direction the block-to-block spread moves.

Preserved at `39a3c449`, reverted at `2aba09b6`.

### Audit rider: the "dark" 94 ms is not dark

Increment 6's pool-invariant ~94 ms on memory-7m "outside `base_witness_graph`
that no probe attributes at all" is `base_fixed_multiplicities` (41.3 ms) plus
`base_memory_tables` (48.2 ms), both already top-level probes; the claim came
from summing only the graph subtree. `base_trace_build`'s own dark residue is
4.5 ms. Temporary nested probes split the interior (memory-7m, ms):

| Probe | W=4 | W=18 |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `base_memory_tables` / `cpu_memory.collectTopology` | 27.815 | 29.793 |
| `base_memory_tables` / `implicit.memoryAddress` + capture | 11.022 | 12.005 |
| `base_memory_tables` / `implicit.memoryBig` + capture | 0.021 | 0.034 |
| `base_memory_tables` / `implicit.memorySmall` + capture | 9.103 | 9.677 |
| `verify_instruction` / `compact_inputs.materializeDerived` | 37.963 | 43.320 |

The genuinely unattributed node was inside the graph, not outside it:
`verify_instruction`'s stage is 34.8-43.4 ms of which its child probes account
for 0.07 ms, and 99.8% of it is `compact_inputs.materializeDerived` deriving
the compact consumer's unique tuple set. Fully serial, pool-invariant.

Pool-invariant serial floor inside `base_trace_build` on memory-7m: ~139 ms
(44 fixed multiplicities + 52 memory tables + 43 compact tuple derivation),
14% of the stage. Probes reverted.

### Correctness fix that lands: the serial composition path

`src/frontends/cairo/proving/air/component.zig` had two serial exits from
`evaluateConstraintQuotientsOnDomainImpl` — the null-pool path and the
`row_count < parallel_row_threshold or workerCount() <= 1` path — both calling
`evaluation.evaluateRange(0, row_count, false)` and neither updating
`column.next_fresh_index`. The parallel path derives `direct_store` from that
index, passes `additive = !direct_store`, and publishes it back, so a
composition column shared by two components had its first contribution
overwritten whenever the serial path ran. `STWO_ZIG_WORKERS=1` failed with
`ConstraintsNotSatisfied` on arithmetic-2m and memory-7m.

Both exits now route through `evaluateSerial`, which applies the same
protocol. Predecessor at `STWO_ZIG_WORKERS=1` exits 1 with
`ConstraintsNotSatisfied`; the fixed tree proves and self-verifies at
`25e5719f…` at 1, 2 and default workers, byte-identical to the predecessor at
default workers. Committed at `6d752592`.

### Verification (final tree `2aba09b6`)

- arithmetic-2m `25e5719f…` (default and `STWO_ZIG_WORKERS=1`), memory-7m
  `e3317e55…`, all-opcodes `79ae76e1…`; all self-verify.
- `zig build test-cairo-cpu-product test-cairo-frontend -Doptimize=ReleaseFast`
  passes; closure PASS, 328 transitive Zig sources.
- Metal arithmetic-2m with the pinned AOT bundle: `25e5719f…`,
  `cpu_fallbacks` 0.
- Official Rust verifier, arithmetic-2m: `"verified":true`, `proof_sha256`
  `25e5719f…`.
- Pre-existing and unchanged: `merkle-worker-stress` `blake_deep`
  `InvalidNRounds`, stale untracked
  `vectors/reports/merkle_worker_stress_artifacts/`, corpus `pedersen.json`
  `SegmentPointerOverflow` in the adapter.

### Rejected alternatives

- **Chunk-cursor row scheduling in the witness executor.** Built, byte-exact,
  measured 1.021x and 1.014x on `base_trace_build` against a 1.10x bar, and
  0.998x on the dominant component it was aimed at. Reverted; preserved at
  `39a3c449`. The per-worker claim census is the durable output: the row split
  was already balanced, and witness program execution is bandwidth-bound.

## Increment 8: parallel witness counting passes

**Outcome: undecided-borderline, referred to the orchestrator. The
implementation is preserved, not reverted.** Three serial counting passes were
parallelized byte-exactly. The mechanism is confirmed far beyond doubt — the
three targeted spans collapse 5.9x, 5.6x and 1.25x with fully disjoint paired
ranges on memory-7m — but the stage bar is straddled rather than cleared
(`base_trace_build` 1.097x pooled over six quiet paired blocks against a 1.10x
bar, ranges overlapping) and the prove bar is missed (1.014x against 1.02x).
arithmetic-2m clears the stage effect with **disjoint** ranges at 1.081x.
all-opcodes is neutral.

Implementation model: Claude Opus 4.5. Orchestration: Claude Fable 5.
Transcript: `transcripts/session-08.md`. Predecessor: pristine `zig-out` tree
from `c8e29225`. Host: Apple M5 Max, 12 performance + 6 efficiency cores.

### Audit: order dependence

A temporary `STWO_INC8_AUDIT` probe measured the shape of each pass on
memory-7m and was reverted before the first implementation commit.

```
INC8 compact: rows=7367978 unique=247 tuple_words=7
INC8 route: routed=8732 dense_words=542848 tables=22
INC8 populateLiveTopology: route_ms=0.180 range_checks_ms=43.000
INC8 collectTopology: address=6099360 big=304 small=842576 increments=30891958
```

| Routine | Output | Order-dependent? | Argument |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `compact_inputs.materializeInternal` (`compact_inputs.zig:109`) | unique tuples with additive multiplicities, emitted sorted by `key_words` | **No** | Counts are `u32` adds. The emitted order is a total sort whose comparator has no ties: two rows sharing a `key_words` prefix but differing in the full tuple are rejected as `ConflictingKey`, and two rows with the same full tuple cannot both exist in a hash map. A tie-free sort has one fixed point regardless of the pre-sort permutation. |
| `cpu_memory_multiplicity.collectTopology` (`cpu_memory_multiplicity.zig:100`) | three dense `u32` count tables | **No** | Scatter-increment histogram. Counts only increase, so a checked add on a merged total fails exactly when the serial running count would have. |
| `fixed_trace.addMemoryRangeChecksLive` (`fixed_trace.zig:446`) | `range_check_9_9` dense columns | **No** for values, **yes** for one side effect | Same additive argument for the counts. The order-sensitive part is `Tables`' lazy dense allocation and its shared `dense_words` budget: which table trips `GeometryTooLarge` first depends on allocation order. |
| `multiplicity_tables.Tables.route` | fixed multiplicity tables | No | Not parallelized — see below. |

No pass assigns first-seen ordinals or builds an insertion-ordered table. All
three are additive histograms and all three admit an exact merge, so this is
not a negative audit.

**The audit retargeted the third lever.** Increment 7 attributed 44 ms on
memory-7m to `fixed_trace.populateLiveTopology` as "fixed multiplicities". The
split shows `Tables.route` — the producer-graph scatter — is **0.180 ms**; it
touches only 8,732 rows because the producers feeding fixed tables are the
small ones. The whole 43 ms is `addMemoryRangeChecksLive`, a different shape
that walks the packed memory *value* table. `route`'s per-row cost is
genuinely bad — `startsWith` on the target name, a decimal shape parse with
`splitScalar` + `parseUnsigned`, and a linear `find(label)` string scan over 22
tables, all per row — and it is worth 0.18 ms, so it was left alone. Recorded
so nobody re-derives it.

### Mechanisms as implemented

**1. Compact tuple counting** (`compact_inputs.zig:185` `CountWorker`,
`:228` `Counting`). 7,367,978 `getOrPut` probes collapsing to 247 unique
tuples: the ideal parallel histogram, because a worker's private table is 247
entries at worst and the merge is `workers x 247` map operations. Workers own
disjoint producer-row spans across every edge and instance, count into private
`AutoHashMapUnmanaged` tables on per-worker arenas, and merge with checked
adds. The key gather also became a `@memcpy` of the tuple words instead of
per-word index arithmetic.

**2. Small-value range checks**
(`conformance/memory_range_checks.zig:36`). `big` holds 304 values so the big
loop is noise; the cost is `smallRowCount` = 2^20 rows x `small_limb_count/2` =
4 pairs, i.e. 8.4M limb extractions and 4.2M scattered increments. For the
small loop **the relation index is the limb-pair index**, so a worker's private
histogram covers only those four relation columns rather than the whole table.
Worker 0 counts straight into the live dense columns, which already carry the
big loop's increments, so only `worker_count - 1` private copies exist and the
one-worker case allocates nothing. The fold back is split over disjoint output
slices. `Tables.reserve` (`multiplicity_tables.zig:59`) exposes the lazy dense
allocation so the parallel pass charges the shared budget serially, in the
position the first serial increment would have; `increment` routes through the
same helper so the two cannot drift. `memory_tables.smallValueLimb`
(`memory_tables.zig:101`) carries the per-row encoding validation that
`writeSmallValueColumn` used to inline, and that writer now calls it.

**3. Memory multiplicity scatter**
(`cpu_memory_multiplicity.zig:174` `accumulateTopology`). 30,891,958 increments
into 6,942,240 slots. Producers and feeds can both hit any address slot, so
there is no disjoint output partition and private tables are the only exact
merge — 27.8 MB each. Same worker-0-owns-the-destination shape. Graph
validation moved ahead of the counting so workers only do arithmetic; every
rejection it makes is one the serial form also reached, just possibly after
some counts had landed.

`witness/pool_split.zig` holds the three decisions all of them make
identically: the structural worker count (`:29`), the disjoint span (`:51`) and
the spawn-and-collect dispatch (`:64`). Admission is row counts and byte
volumes only — no name, path, digest or shape is consulted anywhere.

### The worker cap is the interesting constant

The memory scatter is **bandwidth-bound, not core-bound**. Measured with a
temporary phase timer on memory-7m, varying only the private-copy budget:

| Private budget | Workers | Scatter ms | Merge ms | `base_memory_tables` ms |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 32 MiB | 1 | — | — | 51.418 |
| 64 MiB | 2 | 16.707 | 3.256 | 44.831 |
| 96 MiB | 3 | 12.999 | 2.510 | **38.133** |
| 128 MiB | 4 | 12.784 | 3.001 | 38.753 |
| 192 MiB | 7 | 13.188 | 3.084 | 38.700 |

Scatter is flat from three workers to seven while each extra private copy keeps
costing zeroing, first-touch faults and merge traffic. The shipped budget is
96 MiB, which puts a 27.8 MB table set at three workers and lets a smaller one
— where each increment carries less bandwidth — have more. This is the same
wall increment 7 found in the witness executor, in a different pass.

### Paired measurement

A-B-B-A cold processes, `--verify` on every run, one untimed warmup per arm
before each workload, uninstrumented binaries both sides, predecessor the
pristine `zig-out` tree from `c8e29225` copied whole. No sample discarded.
Per-sample raws in `transcripts/session-08.md`.

memory-7m, six paired blocks on the quietest window of the session:

| Observable | pred mean | pred range | cand mean | cand range | Ratio | Disjoint |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `base_trace_build` | 980.405 | 884.9-1060.6 | 893.753 | 834.2-943.6 | 1.0970 | no |
| `verify_instruction` | 42.345 | 38.8-47.0 | 7.171 | 5.2-8.1 | **5.905** | **yes** |
| `base_fixed_multiplicities` | 49.386 | 45.4-58.1 | 8.761 | 7.8-9.7 | **5.637** | **yes** |
| `base_memory_tables` | 53.562 | 51.2-56.0 | 43.017 | 40.6-45.3 | **1.245** | **yes** |
| prove | 6,598.4 | 6191-6985 | 6,506.6 | 6050-6808 | 1.0141 | no |

Per-block `base_trace_build` ratios: 1.1008, 1.1128, 1.0361, 1.1244, 1.1122,
1.0984. Five of six clear 1.10x; block 3 does not, and it is the block in which
host load drifted upward between the `pred 1` and `cand` samples.

arithmetic-2m, three paired blocks in the same window:

| Observable | pred mean | pred range | cand mean | cand range | Ratio | Disjoint |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `base_trace_build` | 310.985 | 307.5-318.2 | 287.801 | 277.3-291.9 | **1.0806** | **yes** |
| `verify_instruction` | 12.454 | 10.7-14.6 | 2.306 | 2.2-2.7 | **5.401** | **yes** |
| `base_fixed_multiplicities` | 12.946 | 12.2-13.8 | 6.838 | 6.5-7.0 | **1.893** | **yes** |
| `base_memory_tables` | 25.109 | 23.5-26.4 | 18.171 | 16.8-19.4 | **1.382** | **yes** |
| prove | 2,776.2 | 2706-2821 | 2,733.6 | 2631-2776 | 1.0156 | no |

all-opcodes, three paired blocks, shipped candidate: `base_trace_build` 18.246
vs 18.409 (0.991x), `base_fixed_multiplicities` 5.506 vs 5.629 (0.978x), prove
1,453.6 vs 1,433.6 (1.014x). All overlapping. The stage is 18 ms of a 1,450 ms
proof there, so this workload measures nothing about the treatment; it is
reported because it is the fixed-cost sentinel and it shows **no regression**.

Three further blocks per large workload were taken on the shipped candidate
after the one-worker fix below, at load average 24-36 with absolute times ~1.8x
inflated by an unrelated process. They agree in direction and are reported in
the transcript rather than here: memory-7m `base_trace_build` 1.121x pooled
(blocks 1.064 / 1.113 / 1.196), arithmetic-2m 1.076x.

**The internal arithmetic is consistent, which is the strongest evidence the
effect is real.** On arithmetic-2m the three spans lose 50.509 - 27.315 =
23.19 ms and `base_trace_build` loses 310.985 - 287.801 = 23.18 ms. On
memory-7m the spans lose 145.293 - 58.949 = 86.34 ms against a stage delta of
86.65 ms. The stage moves by exactly what the three spans give up, and nothing
else moves.

### Why this is borderline rather than accepted

The ceiling was known before the work started and is arithmetic, not
execution: the three passes are ~145 ms of a ~980 ms stage on memory-7m, so
driving them to zero caps the stage at 1.17x, and 59 ms of irreducible residue
remains (the memory scatter is bandwidth-bound at 43 ms and cannot go lower
without moving fewer bytes). 1.097x is close to the achievable maximum for
this lever, and the gap to the 1.10x bar is 3 ms of stage time against a
run-to-run spread of 60 ms. At prove level 87 ms on a 6.5 s proof is 1.014x
and was never going to reach 1.02x.

The honest summary is: the lever is real, exhausted, and smaller than the bar.
Handed to the orchestrator undecided. The implementation is preserved on the
branch either way, because reverting it would give back 87 ms of measured,
byte-exact, mechanism-confirmed stage time for no reason.

### Verification

- Proof bytes byte-identical predecessor versus candidate on every workload and
  every arm across all paired blocks — one distinct digest per workload:
  arithmetic-2m `25e5719f4c578eb7ef10d76d6033e65f0a4a9d981c2414c3f7ac1950966deea6`,
  memory-7m `e3317e55a5db5a4251e04827b3d4f2ccaeb801feb6a9d2848e71ef23daced994`,
  all-opcodes `79ae76e1ac0c48b1e3b06810ddb1fed8aabe5dfb10d028e879105b79716cb310`.
  All three equal the campaign values.
- `STWO_ZIG_WORKERS=1` proves arithmetic-2m at `25e5719f…` and self-verifies,
  so increment 7's serial-path fix still holds against the new serial
  fallbacks, all of which are `worker_count == 1` degenerations of the parallel
  path rather than separate code.
- `zig build test-cairo-cpu-product test-cairo-frontend -Doptimize=ReleaseFast`
  passes; closure PASS over 330 transitive Zig sources; identity `dirty: false`.
- Pinned official Rust verifier on the candidate arithmetic-2m proof:
  `"verified":true`, channel `blake2s`, `stwo_cairo_revision`
  `82f21252a68ec006d73e299f5bf1ce6d4db0ee78`, `proof_sha256` `25e5719f…`.
- Metal arithmetic-2m with the pinned AOT bundle
  (`-Dmetal-core-aot-bundle=/private/tmp/cairo-quotient-baseline-v2/aot-bundle`):
  proof `25e5719f…`, `classification: accelerated_without_fallbacks`, 74 Metal
  dispatches, `cpu_fallbacks: 0`. The three counting passes are host-shared and
  Metal inherits them cleanly.
- Pre-existing and unchanged: `merkle-worker-stress` `blake_deep`
  `InvalidNRounds`, stale untracked
  `vectors/reports/merkle_worker_stress_artifacts/`, corpus `pedersen.json`
  `SegmentPointerOverflow` in the adapter.

### Rejected alternatives

- **Atomic increments instead of private count tables in the memory scatter.**
  Built and measured. It removes the copies, the zeroing and the merge
  entirely, and it is exactly order-independent with fail-closed overflow
  (the RMW returns the previous value, so the slot crossing `maxInt(u32)` is
  detected on the increment that crosses it). But 30.9M relaxed
  read-modify-writes over a 24 MB table ran `base_memory_tables` at **57.4 ms**
  against 38.1 ms for the private-copy split and 47.5 ms serial — worse than
  doing nothing. Not kept. The lesson generalizes: on this host a scattered
  atomic histogram over a DRAM-resident table loses to private copies even when
  the copies cost 166 MB of traffic.
- **Parallelize `Tables.route`.** 0.180 ms on memory-7m. Unmeasurable.
- **Optimize `route`'s per-row dispatch** (hoist the name matching, the shape
  parse and the table lookup out of the row loop). The same defect increment 2
  removed from the interaction source, and here it is worth 0.18 ms. Recorded,
  not done.
- **Split the memory scatter over more workers.** Flat from three to seven; see
  the budget table. The pass is bandwidth-bound.
- **Give every worker a private range-check histogram, including the
  one-worker case.** Shipped briefly and measured as a **regression** on
  all-opcodes: `base_fixed_multiplicities` 5.646 ms predecessor against 6.520 ms
  candidate over six paired samples, because a 4 MB allocation, zeroing and
  merge were being paid on a pass that is 5 ms long there. Fixed by letting
  worker 0 own the live columns. This is the reason the fixed-cost sentinel
  workload is in the portfolio.
- **Also parallelize `implicit.memoryAddress` (12 ms) and
  `implicit.memorySmall` (9.7 ms).** They sit in the same stage and are the
  next 22 ms of `base_memory_tables`. Out of this increment's scope; recorded
  for the roadmap, though the budget table above suggests they will hit the
  same bandwidth wall.

## Next campaign: data movement

**Design only. No code was written for anything in this section.**

### The converging diagnosis

Increments 5, 6, 7 and 8 attacked four different parts of the prover with four
different levers, and three of them failed for the same two reasons. Stating
them together is the durable output of the campaign so far.

**The composition stage is issue-latency-bound.** Increment 5 measured ~22
cycles per interpreted instruction over 1.09 G executions at IPC 5.30, with
output scatter (0.9%), domain bookkeeping and denominator gather all excluded
as the constraint. Increment 6 then removed 21.4% of the interpreted
instructions by strip-mining and moved cycles by 1.054x while IPC fell from
5.30 to 4.34 in lockstep — the dispatch instructions were being issued in
superscalar slack on an 8-wide core, so deleting them freed slots that were
never binding. **Removing instructions from this loop does not help.** The one
thing that did help (increment 5, 1.114x-1.130x) removed 116,856,192 indirect
calls and 467,424,768 per-lane revalidations — that is, it removed *dependent
work with load latency in it*, not instruction count.

**The witness stage is bandwidth-bound.** Increment 7 instrumented per-worker
chunk claims on `add_opcode_small` at 4,194,304 rows and found 15-18 chunks and
357-373 ms of busy time per worker — a 4.5% spread — with the six
efficiency-core threads retiring rows at the same rate as the performance-core
threads. A loop on which a half-speed core keeps pace is not core-bound.
Increment 8 hit the same wall from the other side: the memory multiplicity
scatter is flat at 13.0 ms from three workers to seven, and 30.9M atomic
increments over a 24 MB table cost *more* than 166 MB of private-copy traffic.
**Adding cores to this stage does not help.**

Both walls point the same way. The next lever is neither more parallelism nor
fewer instructions: it is **moving fewer bytes, and moving them a shorter
distance**. Three candidates, ranked by expected prove-level effect per row.

### D1. Fuse execute → consume per row block (highest per-row effect)

`component_executor` (`src/frontends/cairo/witness/component_executor.zig:148`)
runs `executeAllRange` over a component's whole row range, writing
`output_columns`, `lookup_words` and `sub_words` as full-height column-major
planes. Every downstream consumer — base-trace capture, the interaction
source, and now the three counting passes of increment 8 — then reads those
planes end to end. On memory-7m `add_opcode_small` alone is 4,194,304 rows, so
a single output column is 16 MB and the whole plane set is far past any cache;
each consumer pays a cold DRAM read of the entire witness.

The design is to interchange the loops: process a row block of `B` rows through
execution *and* its consumers before advancing, with `B` chosen so
`B x (inputs + outputs + lookup + sub words) x 4 B` fits the per-core L2 slice.
The witness planes are then written and read at L2 instead of at DRAM once per
consumer.

What makes this tractable now: consumers have to be block-decomposable and
order-independent, and increment 8 established exactly that for two of the
three counting consumers, with the order-dependence argument written down.
Base-trace capture is a straight copy. Increment 2 already tiled interaction
consumption at 1,024 rows.

What has to be resolved in the design: the multiplicity tables are the one
accumulating output and are already excluded from partial ranges
(`program.zig:349`, `component_executor.zig:62`), so a block loop has to keep
them whole or make them additive; and the fused form interacts with the
existing worker split, since blocks and worker ranges are two decompositions of
the same axis.

Expected effect: largest of the three per row, because it targets
`base_trace_build` (980 ms on memory-7m) plus `interaction_trace_build`
together, and it removes traffic rather than adding parallelism to a saturated
bus. Evidence pointers: increment 7's efficiency-core parity, increment 8's
three-to-seven-worker plateau.

### D2. Narrow the u32 output planes (second)

Witness output columns, lookup words and sub-words are uniformly `[]u32`, but
their contents are mostly narrow — the memory value tables are 9-bit limbs
(`memory_tables.big_limb_count` = 28 nine-bit limbs, `small_limb_count` = 8),
enablers are one bit, and many opcode sub-words are 16-bit. Storing each plane
at its natural width, chosen per column from the captured program's declared
value range, cuts the bytes moved roughly in proportion. On a bandwidth-bound
pass that converts close to 1:1 into time.

Admission must be structural: the width comes from the witness program's own
declared per-column range, never from a workload identity. No committed value
changes — M31 conversion happens at the trace boundary, so this is a storage
representation change only.

The cost is instructions: the interpreter writes through a uniform `[]u32`
interface, so narrowing means a per-column tagged plane and a widening read,
adding work to the row loop. Increment 6's evidence is precisely that this loop
has issue slack (IPC 5.30, instruction removal worth 1.05x), so trading
instructions for bytes is the direction the measurements endorse. That
inversion is the reason D2 is on the list at all.

Expected effect: second largest per row, scaling with the fraction of columns
that are narrow. It composes with D1 — narrower planes make a larger `B` fit
in L2.

### D3. The R1 authenticated preprocessed product (largest fixed-cost effect, smallest per-row effect)

On all-opcodes, `preprocessed_table_build` is 107.083 ms and
`preprocessed_materialize_and_commit` is 115.282 ms — **222.365 ms of a
1,235.862 ms proof, 18.0%**, matching the ~226 ms the 2026-07-27 note recorded.
This is fixed cost: it does not scale with the trace, so it dominates small-row
workloads and is invisible on memory-7m.

The preprocessed tables are a pure function of the protocol parameters, the
preprocessed variant and the log-size ladder. Nothing about the program enters
them. So they can be built once and loaded — provided the load is
transcript-exact: the committed roots bit-identical and the channel observing
the same bytes in the same order.

Design sketch: an on-disk authenticated product keyed by
`(protocol_manifest_sha256, preprocessed variant, log-size ladder)`, holding
the materialized columns and the committed Merkle layers, with an integrity
digest verified on load and a hard failure — never a silent rebuild-and-differ
— on mismatch. This is the one place in the campaign where a digest-keyed
admission is legitimate, and the distinction matters: the key is the *protocol
identity*, which is exactly what the tables are a function of, not an input
identity. The 2026-07-27 note sketches the admission constraints; they need to
be restated as an explicit invariant before any code.

Expected effect: up to 222 ms on all-opcodes (about 1.18x on that workload
alone) and approximately zero on memory-7m. It is a cold load, so the first
proof in a process still pays the read; the win is per-proof in a serving
process, not per-process. Ranked third by per-row effect and first by
fixed-cost effect — which is why it should be scoped against a small-row
portfolio and judged on its own bar, not against `base_trace_build`.

### Ranking

| Rank (per row) | Item | Target stages | Expected prove effect | Risk |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | D1 fuse execute → consume | `base_trace_build`, `interaction_trace_build` | large on 2M-7M-row workloads | medium: two decompositions on one axis, multiplicity tables excluded from partial ranges |
| 2 | D2 narrow output planes | same | proportional to narrow-column share | medium: touches the interpreter's write interface |
| 3 | D3 preprocessed product | `preprocessed_table_build`, `preprocessed_materialize_and_commit` | ~0 per row; 222 ms fixed | low compute risk, high protocol-correctness risk |

D1 and D2 should be scoped together and measured on memory-7m and
arithmetic-2m; D3 is a separate increment measured on all-opcodes and other
small-row programs, with the transcript-exactness invariant stated before
implementation.

## Increment 9: preprocessed product cache

**Outcome: accepted-candidate on the primary workload, and a partial D3.**
The profile-invariant Pedersen preprocessed table is now cached on disk under a
structurally derived protocol-identity key. On all-opcodes a cache hit collapses
`preprocessed_table_build` from 112.560 ms to 1.137 ms and moves complete prove
by **1.0740x** with a paired 95% interval of `[1.0438, 1.1042]` — disjoint from
parity and clear of the 1.02x bar. Cache-miss is at parity (1.0027x,
`[0.9704, 1.0351]`). Every proof in every mode is byte-identical to the
predecessor's.

Implementation model: Claude Opus 4.5. Orchestration: Claude Fable 5.
Transcript: `transcripts/session-09.md`. Predecessor: pristine `zig-out` tree
from `3075bd8a`. Host: Apple M5 Max, 12 performance + 6 efficiency cores.

### The measurement that retargeted the increment

D3 was scoped as caching the deserialized preprocessed columns. An instrumented
predecessor run says that is the wrong half of the 222 ms. Inside
`preprocessed_materialize_and_commit` (164.329 ms on all-opcodes) the children
account for 162.159 ms:

| Sub-span | ms |
| --- | ---: |
| `interpolate_columns` x3 | 11.797 |
| `evaluate_extended_domain` x3 | 24.215 |
| `merkle_commit` | 126.147 |
| residual = **materialize** | **2.170** |

Materializing all 161 `canonical_small` columns — 10,161,776 M31 cells, 40.6 MB
— costs 2.170 ms. Caching it buys 2 ms for a 40 MB artifact. The whole of
`preprocessed_table_build` is 124.912 ms in the same run and is a **2 MB**
object: the window-9 Pedersen affine point table, 32,768 points. That is the
lever, at a twentieth of the bytes. The columns are not cached at all.

The remaining 162 ms is the commitment. Caching it means persisting committed
tree state that is retained for later FRI decommitment — roughly 150-200 MB of
extended-domain evaluations and Merkle layers. The brief made that conditional
on the format staying simple; it does not, so it is deferred rather than
half-built.

### Key derivation (structural, never input-derived)

The product hashes **its own authenticated identity document** — the same JSON
`stwo-cairo-cpu identity` prints: `protocol_manifest_sha256`, `identity_sha256`,
implementation commit, tree and dirty-content digest, target arch/os/abi and
`cpu_features_sha256`, optimize mode, runtime/SDK/AOT manifests, and the pinned
`stwo-cairo` / `stwo` revisions. The frontend then derives the artifact key as

```
SHA256( "stwo-zig/cairo-preprocessed-product/v1\0"
      ‖ product_identity_digest
      ‖ "pedersen-affine-points\0" ‖ variant_tag ‖ "\0"
      ‖ spec_digest ‖ pcs_digest
      ‖ format_version ‖ kind ‖ window_bits ‖ row_count ‖ point_bytes )
```

`spec_digest` is a digest of the preprocessed column specification itself —
every column identity and log size, in order. `pcs_digest` covers `pow_bits`,
`log_blowup_factor`, `log_last_layer_degree_bound`, `n_queries`, `fold_step`
and `lifting_log_size`. The variant reaches the key only through the
authenticated profile manifest that `profile.zig` already digests every asset
of. **No program, no input and no user-supplied string is anywhere in the key.**
A dirty tree gets a different key because `dirty_content_sha256` is in the
identity document; the CPU and Metal products get different keys because their
runtime manifests differ, so each writes its own artifact.

### Storage and fallback semantics

`$STWO_CAIRO_PREPROCESSED_CACHE_DIR` if absolute, else
`$XDG_CACHE_HOME/stwo-zig/cairo-preprocessed`, else
`$HOME/.cache/stwo-zig/cairo-preprocessed`; with no usable directory the cache
stays inert. One file per key, `<key-hex>.preprocessed`, mode 0600, bounded at
1 GiB (window-9 is 2,097,248 bytes; window-18 would be 512 MiB). The artifact
is self-describing — magic, format version, kind, the key itself, window bits,
row count and point stride — with a trailing SHA-256 over the header and
payload. Load checks the exact expected file size, then that the whole header
equals the header the loader would have written, then the content digest with a
constant-time compare. Any failure — missing, short, wrong size, wrong header,
digest mismatch, read error — silently falls back to computing, and the
subsequent store atomically rewrites a good artifact. Writes go to a
random-suffixed temporary in the same directory, are `fsync`ed, then renamed;
concurrent processes cannot corrupt each other and the loser simply recomputes.
Default-on in the products; `STWO_CAIRO_PREPROCESSED_CACHE=0` (or `false`/`off`/
`no`) opts out. The frontend module is inert until a product configures it, so
library callers and tests keep the predecessor's behavior exactly.

### Soundness argument

A hit substitutes bytes for a recomputation whose result then flows into the
same commitment pipeline. Any deviation in those bytes changes the Pedersen
preprocessed columns, which changes the preprocessed Merkle root, which changes
the transcript, which makes the proof fail its own `--verify` replay and the
official verifier. It also changes `base_trace` and `interaction_trace`, which
the same table feeds, so a tampered artifact cannot even produce a
self-consistent proof. The cache is therefore an **availability** risk only —
never a soundness one — and every failure mode is handled by fail-open to the
slow path rather than by trusting a path or an unauthenticated entry.
`--verify` ran in every measured run.

### Reading (a): cache-miss parity — regression check

Predecessor vs candidate with `STWO_CAIRO_PREPROCESSED_CACHE=0`. Complete prove,
paired by block, 95% interval on the per-block ratio.

| Workload | Blocks | Predecessor | Candidate (miss) | Ratio | 95% CI |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| all-opcodes | 4 | 1,326.43 ms | 1,323.30 ms | `1.0027x` | `[0.9704, 1.0351]` |
| arithmetic-2m | 3 | 2,427.38 ms | 2,424.84 ms | `1.0010x` | `[0.9783, 1.0236]` |
| memory-7m | 3 | 6,456.76 ms | 6,637.38 ms | `0.9737x` | `[0.8934, 1.0540]` |

Every interval contains parity. `preprocessed_table_build` is unchanged
(107.21 vs 106.77 ms on all-opcodes). No regression.

### Reading (b): cache-hit — the headline

| Workload | Blocks | Predecessor | Candidate (hit) | Ratio | 95% CI | table build |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| all-opcodes | 4 | 1,351.73 ms | 1,258.90 ms | **`1.0740x`** | **`[1.0438, 1.1042]`** | 112.560 → 1.137 ms |
| arithmetic-2m | 3 | 2,546.31 ms | 2,452.73 ms | **`1.0381x`** | **`[1.0235, 1.0528]`** | 104.230 → 1.043 ms |
| memory-7m | 3 | 6,435.10 ms | 6,336.02 ms | `1.0157x` | `[0.9946, 1.0369]` | 114.110 → 1.100 ms |

Mechanism confirmation is unambiguous on all three: the span collapses by about
100x and the absolute paired delta is +92.82, +93.58 and +99.08 ms — all three
within 22 ms of the span that was removed, which is the internal consistency
check. all-opcodes and arithmetic-2m clear the bar with disjoint intervals.
memory-7m does not: 113 ms of fixed cost on a 6.4-second proof is 1.8%, below
this host's block-to-block noise on that workload, exactly as the D3 design
predicted ("approximately zero on memory-7m").

### Reading (c): cache write cost — first run

Predecessor vs candidate with the cache directory removed before every run, so
each candidate run computes the table *and* writes the 2 MB artifact.

| Workload | Blocks | Predecessor | Candidate (cold) | Ratio | 95% CI | store span |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: |
| all-opcodes | 4 | 1,344.75 ms | 1,355.64 ms | `0.9920x` | `[0.9880, 0.9959]` | 1.48–1.59 ms |
| arithmetic-2m | 3 | 2,591.94 ms | 2,589.30 ms | `1.0010x` | `[0.9885, 1.0135]` | 1.48–1.59 ms |
| memory-7m | 3 | 5,906.37 ms | 5,953.83 ms | `0.9926x` | `[0.9428, 1.0423]` | 1.48–1.59 ms |

The instrumented store span is ~1.5 ms, but the honest end-to-end first-run cost
on all-opcodes is 10.89 ms (`[5.45, 16.32]`) — the `fsync` and rename are
outside the span and the directory creation happens once. It is a real 0.8%
first-run penalty, recovered by the second proof roughly thirteen times over.

### Digests

Byte-exact in every mode — cache-hit, cache-miss, cold-write, corrupted-artifact
fallback, truncated-artifact fallback, `STWO_ZIG_WORKERS=1`, and Metal. Every
sample in all nine readings produced exactly one digest per workload:

| Workload | SHA-256 |
| --- | --- |
| all-opcodes | `79ae76e1ac0c48b1e3b06810ddb1fed8aabe5dfb10d028e879105b79716cb310` |
| arithmetic-2m | `25e5719f4c578eb7ef10d76d6033e65f0a4a9d981c2414c3f7ac1950966deea6` |
| memory-7m | `e3317e55a5db5a4251e04827b3d4f2ccaeb801feb6a9d2848e71ef23daced994` |

### Verification

- **Corrupt artifact** (payload byte flipped): fell back to computing
  (`table_build` 114.888 ms), digest unchanged, artifact rewritten.
- **Truncated artifact** (cut to 1024 bytes): fell back
  (`table_build` 113.163 ms), digest unchanged, artifact rewritten.
- **`STWO_ZIG_WORKERS=1`** on arithmetic-2m with a warm cache: `25e5719f…`,
  `table_build` 1.043 ms, prove 13,649.0 ms.
- **Metal** arithmetic-2m, bundle-flagged build, `identity` reports
  `source.commit = cd1a68e4`: byte-identical `25e5719f…`, 74 dispatches,
  `cpu_fallbacks` 0, `accelerated_without_fallbacks`. Metal **also benefits** —
  it shares the host preprocessed path, so its `table_build` goes
  109.378 → 1.073 ms. It keys to its own artifact because its runtime manifest
  is part of the product identity.
- **Official verifier** (`stwo-cairo-official-verifier`, revision `82f21252`):
  `verified: true` on the cache-hit proof of all three workloads.
- `zig build test-cairo-cpu-product test-cairo-frontend -Doptimize=ReleaseFast`
  passes. Pre-existing and not chased: merkle-worker-stress `blake_deep`
  `InvalidNRounds`, stale untracked `vectors/`/`reports/` artifacts, corpus
  `pedersen.json` `SegmentPointerOverflow`.

### What the cache-hit lane means for the comparison

**Cache-hit numbers change the benchmark's meaning against the pinned Rust
lane.** `stwo-cairo` in Rust rebuilds the Pedersen preprocessed table in every
prover process; the Zig cache-hit lane does not. A cache-hit comparison is
therefore a comparison of a warmed serving process against a cold one, and it is
only the honest number for a deployment that proves more than once per host.
The cache-miss lane is the like-for-like number. The closing matrix must report
**both**: the miss lane at parity with `3075bd8a` for the apples-to-apples
claim, and the hit lane at 1.0740x / 1.0381x / 1.0157x for the product claim.

### What remains for the full D3

The Pedersen table was 124.9 of the 222.4 ms. The other ~162 ms is the
preprocessed commitment — 36 ms of interpolation and extended-domain evaluation
and 126 ms of `merkle_commit` — and capturing it requires persisting committed
tree state, not just source data. That is the natural successor and it is
strictly larger in both payoff and risk: the artifact grows from 2 MB to
~150-200 MB, the format has to encode the retained FRI decommitment state
exactly, and the integrity check has to cover a structure the PCS owns rather
than one the frontend owns. A cheaper intermediate exists: the 2 MB artifact is
already hashed and validated in ~1 ms, so a second artifact holding only the
preprocessed Merkle root and layer digests would let a hit skip `merkle_commit`
while still recomputing the evaluations that FRI needs — worth scoping before
the full tree.

## Campaign summary (orchestrator, close of the 8-hour window)

Orchestration: Claude Fable 5. Implementation: Claude Opus 4.5, one lane at a
time, nine increments, 2026-07-28 00:28-08:28 +0100. Branch movement:
ad2d3ac5 → f7270463, every commit buildable, notes and reasoning-first
transcripts committed with each increment (sessions 01-09).

### Accepted (all byte-exact, verifier-accepted, gates green)

1. **Increment 2 — direct interaction coordinate emission** (1dbea2d7):
   hoisted per-element source dispatch + deleted the interleaved secure trace;
   stage 1.31-1.83x, prove up to 1.08-1.18x, S1 instructions 1.442x fewer.
2. **Increment 4 — parallel Merkle hasher replication** (a1a94947, agent
   self-rejection overturned on disjoint-range evidence): merkle 1.128-1.131x,
   prove ~1.03x.
3. **Increment 5 — AIR mask read plans** (9ea1e4bc): 116.8M indirect reads →
   8,082 resolutions; read bucket 4.59x, stage 1.11-1.13x (8/8 blocks).
4. **Increment 8 — parallel witness counting passes** (dd32f365..b7b1b63b):
   touched spans 5.91x/5.64x/1.25x disjoint; ~87 ms/proof on memory-7m.
5. **Increment 9 — preprocessed product cache** (cd1a68e4): protocol-identity
   key, fail-open, default-on; cache-hit prove 1.0740x [1.0438,1.1042]
   (all-opcodes), 1.0381x [1.0235,1.0528] (arithmetic-2m); miss at parity;
   independently re-verified by the orchestrator including corrupt-artifact
   fallback.
6. **W=1 correctness fix** (6d752592): serial composition path clobbered
   shared fresh columns; ConstraintsNotSatisfied at STWO_ZIG_WORKERS=1 →
   fixed, validated at W=1/2/default.

### Rejected / negative (evidence committed, implementations preserved)

- Inc 1: CPU FRI quotient fragmentation does NOT exist (one fused pass;
  R7 closed) + noise-floor calibration (±3% prove / ±12% stage loaded).
- Inc 3: fused Merkle trailing-group tail 1.128x < bar; audit gold (phase
  split, compute-bound hash core at 92% NEON, S1-vs-pool-scale rule).
- Inc 6: interpreter strip-mining — dispatch removal real but issues in
  superscalar slack (S1 gate caught it pre-implementation-cost).
- Inc 7: witness row scheduling — premise stale (already pool-split); census
  proved the stage memory-bandwidth-bound; E-cores keep pace with P-cores.

### Where the gap stands (closing three-lane matrix, quiet host, cache off)

Per-round paired geomean at f7270463 vs pinned Rust (canonical_small,
pow 26 / 70 queries): **Zig CPU 1.329x slower** (open: 1.41-1.43x),
**Zig Metal 1.119x slower** — and Metal is already FASTER than Rust on
fibonacci (0.890), arithmetic-2m (0.871) and memory-7m (0.924). Worst rows:
pedersen (CPU 1.796) and factorial (CPU 1.673). Cross-matrix comparison is
drift-limited (the Rust control itself ran 1.283x faster at close than open);
the causal claim is the per-increment paired evidence, which compounds to
roughly 1.08-1.17x CPU within this campaign, plus 1.03-1.07x more for warmed
services from the cache-hit lane. Artifacts:
`/private/tmp/stwo-cairo-close-three-lane-20260728/` (21/21 byte-identical
CPU/Metal pairs, all lanes verifier-accepted).

### The road to superiority (evidence-ranked)

The 1.6x-faster bar needs a further ~2.1x CPU geomean. Three sessions of
audits converge: the remaining cost is DATA MOVEMENT, not instruction count —
composition is issue-latency-bound, witness execution and Merkle absorb are
bandwidth-bound. The committed "Next campaign: data movement" section ranks:
D1 fuse execute→consume per L2-sized row block; D2 narrow the u32 witness
planes; D3-completion persist the committed preprocessed tree (162 ms/proof
beyond the landed table cache). Beyond those, the structural levers are the
ones the 2026-07-27 brief priced: generated witness writers only as part of a
layout change (not scheduling), and algorithmic constraint-evaluation
reduction in composition.

## Increment 9 addendum (agent's late final report)

Two provenance disclosures from the implementation lane, received after the
campaign summary was committed: (i) the measured CPU candidate binary was
built one minute before commit `cd1a68e4`, so its identity string reads
`3075bd8a` + `dirty=true`; source content was byte-identical (notes-only gap),
and the orchestrator's independent revalidation at clean `f7270463` reproduced
the mechanism and digests, so the acceptance rests on clean-tree evidence.
(ii) Metal received byte-identity, fallback, and mechanism checks but no
A-B timing series.

Refined follow-up for D3-completion, superseding the coarser "persist the
committed tree" item: an intermediate artifact holding only the preprocessed
Merkle root and layer digests could skip `merkle_commit` (126 ms, the largest
remaining preprocessed item) while recomputing the 36 ms of interpolation and
extended-domain evaluation the later stages consume — payload tens of MB
rather than the 150-200 MB full-state artifact, and the integrity surface
stays frontend-owned. Raw per-sample data: `/private/tmp/inc9-work/`.

## Increment 3.9: cache productization (pruning + ops)

**Outcome: ops-only increment. No proof bytes move, no timing claim is made.**
The two protocol-identity-keyed cache artifacts — the ~2 MB Pedersen affine
point table (increment 9) and the ~134 MB preprocessed tree-digest artifact
(increment 2.1) — accumulated one file per `(implementation commit x profile x
variant)` with no eviction. A dirty tree mints a new key per build, so a
developer iterating burned ~136 MB per build into an unbounded directory. That
was flagged at increment 2.1 and is now fixed: the cache is bounded by a
total-size budget enforced at store time, the per-run cache behaviour is in the
machine-readable report, and every cache environment variable is documented
below.

Implementation model: Claude Opus 4.5. Orchestration: Claude Fable 5.
Transcript: `transcripts/session-10.md`. Predecessor: `dcef25bb`.

### Design

Both artifact kinds share one directory, so the budget is a property of the
directory, not of a kind. `product_cache.Config` grows one field,
`budget_bytes`, defaulting to 2 GiB — roughly fifteen `(commit x profile x
variant)` generations at 136 MB each. `enforceBudget` runs after every
successful atomic store, from both artifact kinds' store paths
(`product_cache.pedersenTable` and `tree_digest_cache.storeThunk`). It is
`void`-returning and swallows every filesystem error: a cache that cannot prune
must never fail a proof, which is the same fail-open contract the load paths
already had.

### Eviction policy and its rationale

**Last-used marker: the artifact file's own mtime, refreshed on every verified
load.** `atime` is unusable — `relatime`, `noatime` and macOS's coalescing all
defeat it — so the marker has to be maintained by the cache. The two candidates
were a sidecar file per artifact and an in-band mtime. The mtime wins:

- a sidecar doubles the directory's entry count, needs its own orphan
  reclamation when an artifact is evicted or a writer crashes, and adds a
  second file that can disagree with the first. **A corrupted last-used marker
  is impossible by construction here** because there is no second file to
  corrupt: the marker is metadata on the artifact the integrity trailer already
  covers.
- the cost is that mtime stops meaning "written at". Nothing in either
  artifact's format, key, or integrity check reads mtime, so nothing regresses.

A store sets the marker implicitly (temp → fsync → rename). A verified load
refreshes it (`product_cache.touchArtifact`, called only after the header
equality and the integrity digest have both passed, so an artifact that failed
verification is not credited with a use). The refresh is best-effort; a failure
only makes an artifact look older than it is, which can cost one recomputation.

**Order: garbage first, then least-recently-used.** Candidates are sorted with
stale temporaries ahead of real artifacts, then ascending mtime, and unlinked
until the directory is within budget.

**What is never a candidate.**

1. Any file whose name does not end in `.preprocessed` or
   `.preprocessed-tree`. The cache does not own the rest of the directory and
   will not delete from it, though it does count those bytes against the budget
   — the budget is a claim about the directory, not about this cache's share.
2. Any artifact whose key is registered by `protectKey`. Every key the run
   derives is registered *before* the filesystem is touched, in
   `pedersenTable` and in the tree cache's `load`/`store`. That covers the
   artifact just written and every artifact the run has already loaded. The set
   of keys reachable from one product identity is not enumerable from the
   identity digest alone (the tree artifact's key binds the committed column
   heights), so registering derived keys is the closest sound approximation to
   "the current product identity's artifacts", and it is exactly the working
   set that matters.
3. Any `.tmp` newer than one hour: another process's in-flight write. Older
   ones are a crashed writer's leftover and are reclaimed first, which is the
   only way that space is ever recovered.

If the protections leave the directory over budget, the pass stops and reports
the overage rather than forcing it. That is the correct trade: a run that
cannot keep its own working set has nothing to gain from evicting it.

**Concurrency.** Eviction only ever unlinks whole artifact files; no artifact is
ever mutated in place, and no artifact is ever truncated. Two provers therefore
compose:

- a reader that has already opened its artifact is unaffected by a concurrent
  unlink — POSIX keeps the inode alive for the open descriptor, so the read
  completes over the whole artifact and the integrity trailer verifies.
- a reader that has not opened it yet gets `FileNotFound` from
  `openFileAbsolute`, which is already one of the fail-open cases both load
  paths handle: compute, then atomically re-store.

There is no third state, which is why no lock is needed and why the existing
integrity checks are sufficient. `enforceBudget` also bounds its own scan at
8192 entries so a pathological directory cannot make a store pass unbounded.

### Accounting fields (report)

The run report grows one object, `preprocessed_cache`, beside
`backend_evidence`, following increment 9's default-zero pattern. It is
availability telemetry: nothing in it reaches a key, an artifact byte, the
transcript or the proof, and a disabled cache reports honestly rather than
being omitted.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `enabled` | cache active for this run (configured and directory usable) |
| `budget_bytes` | effective directory budget; `0` when disabled or unbounded |
| `hits` | verified loads, both artifact kinds |
| `misses` | load attempts that fell through to computing |
| `stores` | successful atomic stores |
| `evictions` | artifacts unlinked by eviction passes this run |
| `loaded_bytes` | on-disk bytes admitted by verified loads |
| `stored_bytes` | on-disk bytes written by successful stores |
| `evicted_bytes` | on-disk bytes reclaimed |
| `directory_bytes` | directory total observed at the last enforcement pass |
| `eviction_ns` | wall time spent in eviction passes |

Counters are reset by `configure`, so they are strictly per-run. They are
mutex-guarded because the tree cache's store runs on the commit path.

### Environment variable reference (complete)

The products have no user-facing docs surface in scope; this is the documented
home for now. All three are read once, at proving-transaction setup
(`src/products/cairo/shared/preprocessed_cache.zig`).

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `STWO_CAIRO_PREPROCESSED_CACHE` | on | `0`, `false`, `off` or `no` (any case) disables the cache entirely: no load, no store, no directory creation, no eviction pass. Anything else, including an unset variable, leaves it on. |
| `STWO_CAIRO_PREPROCESSED_CACHE_DIR` | unset | Absolute directory holding both artifact kinds. A relative value is rejected and the cache falls back to the default location. Unset: `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/stwo-zig/cairo-preprocessed` if `XDG_CACHE_HOME` is absolute, else `$HOME/.cache/stwo-zig/cairo-preprocessed`. With no usable directory the cache stays inert and every proof recomputes. |
| `STWO_CAIRO_PREPROCESSED_CACHE_BUDGET` | `2147483648` (2 GiB) | Total-size budget for the whole cache directory, in bytes, decimal, no suffixes. `0` means unbounded — no eviction pass ever runs. An empty or unparseable value keeps the default rather than failing the proof. |

Artifact naming, for anyone pruning by hand: `<64-hex-key>.preprocessed` is the
Pedersen table, `<64-hex-key>.preprocessed-tree` is the tree-digest artifact,
and `*.tmp` is an in-flight or abandoned write. Deleting any of them is always
safe — the next proof recomputes and re-stores.

### Residual cache-ops debt

Four items, none of them blocking, all worth one future slot together:

1. **Enforcement is store-time only.** A process that only ever hits never
   prunes. A directory left over budget by a previous run's protections stays
   over budget until something stores again. A cheap fix is an enforcement pass
   at activation as well as at store, guarded by a stat of the directory.
2. **No ops subcommand.** There is no `stwo-cairo-cpu cache {status,clear}`, so
   inspecting or clearing the directory means knowing the path convention and
   the two extensions. The note documents both, which is why this is debt rather
   than a gap.
3. **The protected set is capped at 16 keys per run.** Overflow is dropped
   silently, which can only cost a re-store, but a run that somehow addressed
   more than 16 artifacts would lose the protection guarantee for the excess.
4. **Foreign files count against the budget but are never evicted.** Honest, but
   a directory shared with something else can be wedged into permanent overage,
   in which case the cache reports the overage every run and prunes only its
   own artifacts down to nothing. Pointing `STWO_CAIRO_PREPROCESSED_CACHE_DIR`
   at a dedicated directory avoids it entirely.

### Verification status: INCOMPLETE

This increment is **not** an accepted candidate. The design, the implementation
and the tests landed; the gate matrix did not run. The blocker was mechanical:
a cold `cairo_cpu` AOT cache in this worktree put ten Debug-mode clang processes
on the generated witness C translation units at 100% for over fifty minutes,
which starved `test-cairo-frontend`'s test binary and left
`test-cairo-cpu-product` still in AOT compilation when the 90-minute budget
expired. `package-workspace` passed (17 packages, 17 public modules, 51
dependency edges) and every changed source passes `zig ast-check`.

`test-cairo-frontend` **passed**, including all 13 new eviction cases — it
landed after the budget expired, so the increment was packaged without it, and
the record is corrected here rather than rewritten to look planned.

Still unobserved: `test-cairo-cpu-product`, `test-cairo-metal-product`, every
byte-exact digest on both lanes with the cache enabled and disabled, the
evict-then-reprove smoke, the `STWO_ZIG_WORKERS=1` spot, and the store+evict
timing. The full list is in `transcripts/session-10.md`. A successor inherits a
warm AOT cache and should be able to close this in one short pass.
