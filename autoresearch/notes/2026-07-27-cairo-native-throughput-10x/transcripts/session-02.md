# Session 02: Cairo frontend placement and feed architecture

## Scope

Continue the Cairo system-throughput search by determining whether the large
gap from native Stwo is caused by the frontend, the proof backend, or both.
Retain the official proof protocol, exact proof bytes, the seven-workload
portfolio, and zero-fallback Metal requirements.

## Profiling expansion

Added opt-in nested stage scopes for:

- base geometry, live witness graph, fixed multiplicities, memory tables, and
  base finalization;
- every live witness component;
- witness input materialization, output allocation, output initialization,
  bytecode execution, base lowering, and feed retention;
- fixed and dynamic interaction components; and
- interaction memory and fixed-table multiplicity collection.

The instrumentation is inactive when no recorder is supplied. CPU and Metal
product tests passed, and profiled proofs retained exact bytes.

Artifacts:

- `/private/tmp/cairo-portfolio-profile-413e479f`;
- `/private/tmp/cairo-component-profile-current-v2`;
- `/private/tmp/cairo-interaction-profile-274de4cb-v2`;
- `/private/tmp/cairo-component-breakdown-v2`; and
- `/private/tmp/cairo-direct-feed-portfolio-v1`.

## Placement finding

The official Cairo Metal product accelerates PCS, quotient, and FRI. Base
witness execution, interaction construction, and Cairo AIR composition remain
on the host. This explains why native Metal kernel improvements did not
automatically give Cairo native-like committed-cell rates.

The initial complete-proof profile measured:

```text
workload             CPU ms      Metal ms
all-opcodes          1399.633     1468.499
poseidon             1051.519      962.365
pedersen             3915.226     3760.697
fibonacci-100k       1881.557     1572.172
factorial-100k       2495.791     2226.772
arithmetic-2m        3979.103     3320.931
memory-7m           10611.957     9075.963
```

The approximate frontend share was 12-13% for all-opcodes, 13-14% for
Poseidon, 78-82% for Pedersen, 37-46% for Fibonacci, 36-41% for Factorial,
49-59% for Arithmetic, and 54-64% for Memory.

An additional Memory 7m interaction split attributed 609.188 ms to relation
fraction construction and batch inversion, 108.156 ms to lowering interleaved
QM31 values into four commitment coordinates, and about 114 ms to
multiplicity/source preparation and finalization. This makes device-resident
relation construction and inversion a stronger target than optimizing the
coordinate transpose in isolation.

`/usr/bin/sample` attributed the main active CPU stacks to the witness graph,
BLAKE2s commitments, Cairo AIR evaluation, and circle transforms. A true Metal
device trace was unavailable because `xctrace` requires full Xcode and the
active developer directory is `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools`.

## Accepted: authenticated Pedersen point reuse

The Pedersen aggregator made 56 window-nine partial-EC deduction calls per
row. Each call recomputed fixed table points. Reusing the exact transaction
preprocessed table reduced complete proving from 3,915.226 to 1,509.376 ms on
CPU and from 3,760.697 to 1,369.378 ms on Metal.

The proof remained 769,097 bytes with SHA-256
`2f22237a78c26b5abaae644979c0caaf3fc7c8bf4587c8b2d050ff42acb71325`.

## Rejected: interpreter loop reshaping

Three interpreter experiments preserved exact proofs but failed the portfolio:

1. An instruction-major liveness-tiled SIMD interpreter made all-opcodes
   locally faster but regressed Arithmetic and was nearly neutral on Memory.
2. A fully expanded row interpreter increased code and instruction-cache
   pressure, regressing the large workloads by 8-11%.
3. Branch-free operand loading was neutral or slower.

All three implementations were removed. The result is evidence that the
successor must be generated/AOT code with backend-shaped storage, not another
generic interpreter switch arrangement.

## Accepted: direct canonical lookup feeds

The component breakdown changed the diagnosis. Memory 7m
`add_opcode_small` measured:

```text
component wall                  2524.950 ms
input materialization              5.526 ms
output initialization             115.268 ms
program execution                 176.498 ms
base lowering                      40.838 ms
feed retention                   2154.826 ms
```

The retained lookup feed was written row-major and then transposed into the
column-major interaction layout. The candidate:

- emits canonical column-major lookup words directly;
- matches the existing Metal generated-witness layout;
- transfers lookup and subcomponent ownership into the producer graph; and
- skips clearing outputs only when static straight-line coverage proves that
  every destination is overwritten.

Partial writers have a regression test and retain zero initialization.

Memory 7m CPU fell from 10,115.634 to 7,140.352 ms in the direct layout screen,
then to 7,039.236 ms after safe clear elimination. The final portfolio row was
6,888.709 ms. Metal fell from 8,702.380 to 5,679.277 ms before the clear
refinement and measured 5,069.174 ms in the final portfolio.

## Final diagnostic portfolio

```text
workload             CPU ms     CPU gain    Metal ms   Metal gain
all-opcodes          1430.705      0.978x    1384.647      1.061x
poseidon             1069.266      0.983x     925.778      1.040x
pedersen             1528.133      2.562x    1355.564      2.774x
fibonacci-100k       1648.315      1.142x    1254.109      1.254x
factorial-100k       2156.506      1.157x    1775.236      1.254x
arithmetic-2m        2810.166      1.416x    2044.014      1.625x
memory-7m            6888.709      1.541x    5069.174      1.790x
geometric mean                     1.323x                  1.458x
```

Every pair verified with byte-identical proof hashes. Metal used 73-79
dispatches and zero CPU fallbacks. This is a one-shot diagnostic screen; it
does not satisfy the multi-round promotion contract.

## Next architecture

The profiles support four system changes:

1. Build-generated CPU witness writers keyed by collision-resistant semantic
   program identity.
2. General Metal AOT witness admission for live Cairo geometry rather than an
   SN2-only resident schedule.
3. One planned arena for base columns, lookup feeds, interaction outputs, and
   commitment ownership.
4. Backend interfaces for interaction and AIR evaluation so Metal does not
   remain a PCS-only accelerator.

The branch has not reached the 10x forcing target. The accepted work advances
the broad portfolio while preserving the exact proof protocol and identifies
the architecture required for the next order of improvement.

## Generated writers and generalized Metal placement

Generated native CPU writers were admitted by the full 256-bit semantic
program identity and bound into both focused products. On Memory 7m, CPU
witness execution improved `630.323 -> 492.046 ms`; Metal's host witness
execution improved `627.719 -> 557.105 ms`. Complete proof changes were small,
so this was accepted for architecture and stage-level evidence rather than
promoted as a portfolio speed claim.

The official Metal witness generator was then advanced to codegen v7 and
completed for deduction selectors 12-18. Focused runtime compilation passed:

```text
add_mod_builtin                        140,514 source bytes
mul_mod_builtin                       296,565 source bytes
blake_compress_opcode                 163,379 source bytes
pedersen_aggregator_window_bits_9     545,878 source bytes
poseidon_aggregator                   327,857 source bytes
ec_op_builtin                       3,167,670 source bytes; 143.41 s compile
```

The complete official translation unit was 12,120,041 bytes across 128
kernels. The result rules out runtime monolithic JIT. Production must compile
shards in parallel offline and link one authenticated metallib.

A generic Metal relation executor was wired behind an explicit frontend
interface. Its first normalized-source version produced exact proofs but
regressed all-opcodes interaction construction from 142.917 to 489.375 ms.
Direct physical layout binding reduced that to 366.539 ms. Descriptor
projection then reduced transfer volume further.

Arithmetic 2m diagnostics after projection:

```text
main relation rows=2,097,152 columns=5
GPU relation time                         16.751 ms
host source copy                          96.889 ms
output gather                             14.191 ms
complete interaction trace               536.534 ms
complete proof                          2,162.338 ms
```

Memory 7m remained exact with proof SHA-256
`1cc39978f3d0ba73a7974f173f156c2f9b6ae966a107aa041cc600cd50fe8ffc`,
zero fallbacks, and 4,892.090 ms reported proving time. The interaction trace
was 1,062.226 ms, including 849.440 ms inside host-bridged relation
materialization. Maximum RSS was 9,760,882,688 bytes.

This candidate is rejected for default placement. It is retained behind
`STWO_CAIRO_METAL_HOST_BRIDGED_LOGUP=1` as an exact differential and profiling
harness. Default Metal proving continues to use the faster host materializer
until generated witness outputs, lookup feeds, interaction outputs, and PCS
commitment share one resident backing.

## Resident lookup-feed increment

The copied bridge isolated source movement as the dominant cost, so the next
candidate changed ownership rather than the relation kernels. The interaction
executor can now allocate retained lookup storage before witness execution.
Metal allocates an exact shared arena for the lookup source, relation outputs,
challenges, claimed sum, and scan scratch. The generated host writer writes
directly through the shared buffer's CPU mapping, and the producer transports
only an opaque backend residency identity into LogUp.

The first exact all-resident screen looked positive against an earlier loaded
control, but a same-build all-opcodes control measured 1,351.424 ms default
versus 1,532-1,555 ms resident. This rejected one synchronized GPU epoch per
component. The implementation now admits a generated relation only when its
source plus coordinate outputs cover at least `2^22` field cells. Smaller and
implicit relations use the existing CPU/SIMD materializer pending batching.

All-opcodes admitted no relations and measured 1,504.393 ms in the final
diagnostic; the default/hybrid difference is not claimed because unrelated
proof stages varied. Both paths retained exact SHA-256
`c85871be873122a30a4c6e9c553a368281d206bc55d78c0a40ea16d819474740`.

Arithmetic 2m used five resident relation epochs and measured 1,988.535 ms
versus a same-build 2,101.387 ms default (`1.057x`). Interaction construction
fell from 358.161 to 234.601 ms, making the improvement attributable rather
than a whole-proof timing coincidence. Its exact proof SHA-256 remained
`caf3c89b90d69b7c35baace30ba9892e3e9c30a8a03f5f59213018477db4ae9f`.

A single bounded Memory 7m hybrid run used eight resident relation epochs and
measured 4,649.810 ms versus the committed generated-writer default of
4,973.406 ms (`1.070x`). Interaction construction was 529.173 ms versus
938.298 ms in the prior default profile, and the proof retained SHA-256
`1cc39978f3d0ba73a7974f173f156c2f9b6ae966a107aa041cc600cd50fe8ffc`.
All three proofs independently verified with zero CPU fallbacks.

The run also exposed missing evidence granularity: relation commands were real
Metal work but absent from the aggregate dispatch counters. A dedicated
relation-epoch counter was added at the shared recipe boundary. The candidate
will not be promoted from these single samples; retained storage and the
structural large-relation policy are accepted for exactness and positive
large-workload evidence, while small-relation batching remains future work.
The final experimental selector is
`STWO_CAIRO_METAL_RESIDENT_LOGUP=1`; the prior host-bridge selector remains a
compatibility alias for this research branch.
