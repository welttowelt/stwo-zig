//! Per-proof injection point for a whole-stage device composition evaluator.
//!
//! `ComponentProvers.computeCompositionEvaluationForBackend` already dispatches
//! an optional accelerator through the proof's backend *type*, which keeps CPU
//! and Metal proofs isolated when they run concurrently in one process. That
//! mechanism cannot carry a Cairo-specific evaluator: the Metal backend module
//! does not — and must not — know what a captured Cairo AIR program is.
//!
//! This is the other half of the same discipline. The stage is a value carried
//! on `ProveOptions`, so it is scoped to exactly one `prove` call, it is
//! supplied by whoever owns both the frontend types and the backend runtime
//! (`integrations/cairo_metal`), and no process-global hook participates in
//! dispatch. A proof that was given no stage behaves exactly as before.
//!
//! ## The fail-closed contract, which is the reason for the `?` in the return
//!
//! `evaluate` returns `null` to **decline**, and declining is not an error: the
//! caller then runs the unchanged host composition path for the whole stage.
//! Implementations must convert every internal refusal — an unauthenticated
//! library, an unresolvable kernel, an arena that will not plan, a device error
//! — into a decline, and must count it so that a proof which fell back cannot
//! report itself as fully accelerated. An error returned from `evaluate` is
//! therefore a *bug*, not a fallback, and propagates.
