//! Deferred first-tree commitment.
//!
//! The first committed tree's contents are channel-independent — only the
//! ORDER of Merkle-root mixes into the channel is protocol-bound. This
//! module runs that tree's full build on a dedicated worker thread so it
//! overlaps the next commit's build; the pending root is joined and mixed
//! in original order at the `tree_builders.appendCommittedTree` choke point
//! before any later tree is appended. Proof bytes are identical to the
//! sequential path by construction.
//!
//! Deferral gates (see `canDeferFirstTree`): multi-threaded build, first
//! tree only, and non-empty non-constant columns. Both twiddle-source
//! modes are deferral-safe: borrowed towers are immutable, and the owned
//! cache serializes lookup/insert behind its own mutex, so the worker and
//! the main thread may request trees concurrently.
//! Spawn failure falls back to the sequential path; `discard` drains an
//! unresolved build on abort.
