//! The Option-A device composition product hook.
//!
//! This is the module that finally puts a Cairo composition evaluation on the
//! device from the *product* prove path. Everything it relies on was measured
//! rather than assumed by increments 3.4-3.7:
//!
//! - the eleven-offset `EvalLayout` ABI, the interaction/global column
//!   indirection, the denominator index basis `row >> trace_log_size` and the
//!   `rc_base` coefficient offset (3.5 §6, verified on four real components
//!   including a 41-part and a 90-part one);
//! - the lifted-column identity map at evaluation-domain length, and therefore
//!   the *lift* this hook stages inputs through (3.5 §1, 3.7 §3-4);
//! - that the authenticated AOT metallib and a JIT library of the same source
//!   agree to within 0.4% in steady state, so no compiler discount applies
//!   (3.7 §1-2); and
//! - the steady-state cost model, 4.54 ns per row-part plus a 0.1763 ms
//!   per-dispatch floor (3.7 §2).
//!
//! ## Admission, and what "fail closed" means at each layer
//!
//! `open` is the only place a decision is made, and it makes three:
//!
//! 1. **The library.** `composition_aot.authenticate` under the process policy —
//!    the checked-in manifest by default. A rejection declines the whole stage
//!    and the proof runs the unchanged host composition path. This is *not*
//!    counted as a CPU fallback, and the reason is worth stating: before this
//!    increment every Metal Cairo proof evaluated composition on the host with
//!    `cpu_fallbacks = 0`, so a decline returns the proof to exactly the path
//!    the whole campaign has been measuring. Calling that a fallback would
//!    retroactively mis-classify every proof in the record. It is recorded as a
//!    `composition_device_declined` stage marker and logged at error level.
//! 2. **The arena.** Every expressible component is planned
//!    (`composition_eval_arena.plan`) and the shared buffer is sized to the
//!    largest plan. A planning refusal or a plan over the byte cap declines the
//!    whole stage, before any allocation.
//! 3. **The kernels.** Every part of every planned component must resolve by
//!    `kernelName(semantic_hash)` out of the *authenticated* library. A
//!    component with an unresolvable part is dropped from the accepted set and
//!    evaluated on the host inside the stage — this is **declared coverage, not a
//!    fallback**, and it is the mechanism that lets a workload with one
//!    unexpressible component still measure the device stage on the rest.
//!    Against `air_template_composition_eval_domain_v1` (increment 3.13) the
//!    census is 46/46 components on all-opcodes, 28/29 on arithmetic-2m and
//!    31/32 on memory-7m: the two stragglers are single components whose parts
//!    the template library does not emit, and they are declared coverage rather
//!    than a decline precisely because the whole-stage refusal in the row below
//!    would otherwise make those two workloads unmeasurable.
//!
//! A dispatch that fails *after* admission held is the one genuinely unexpected
//! case: that proof started composition on the device and finished it on the
//! host, so it records `.cpu_composition_evaluation` and can no longer report
//! `accelerated_without_fallbacks`.
//!
//! ## The lift is the staging pass
//!
//! There is no separate upload. Writing each column's lifted, evaluation-domain
//! copy into the arena *is* the staging, and it is timed as its own
//! `composition_device_lift` span so the surcharge 3.7 priced at 19-28% of the
//! device stage is measured rather than projected. It parallelises per column
//! with no sharing, over the prover's existing work pool.
