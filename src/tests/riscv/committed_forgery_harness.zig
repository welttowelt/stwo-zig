//! End-to-end committed-trace forgery harness: run a guest, prove it honestly,
//! verify, then re-prove with one row overridden and require rejection.
//!
//! A row-local test says "the AIR would reject this row". It does not say the
//! row can be *reached*: a forgery must survive committing the trace, the
//! interaction argument, and the verifier's global LogUp closure, and a
//! constraint can be row-locally sound while the committed pipeline never
//! evaluates it. So each closed under-constraint needs one test that proves the
//! forged row into a real proof and watches production reject it.
//!
//! Two halves matter equally.
//!
//!  - The HONEST half must pass. A guest that cannot be proven at all would
//!    satisfy "the forgery is rejected" vacuously, so `Guest.proveAndVerify`
//!    is part of every module and its failure is the harness's failure, not
//!    the forgery's.
//!  - The FORGED half must be rejected by the prover's own constraint check or
//!    by verification. Both are acceptable outcomes: an unsatisfied direct
//!    constraint aborts proving with `error.ConstraintsNotSatisfied`, while an
//!    absent lookup tuple survives proving and breaks verification.
//!
//! The honest half also carries the SAIL leg of the soundness argument.
//! "Prove and verify" only shows the witness satisfies the AIR; that the
//! witness *means* RV32IM is exactly what the pinned Sail model is for, and
//! sampling it elsewhere on a different corpus leaves a seam between the two
//! legs. So `proveAndVerify` ends by replaying the guest's retirement trace
//! through pinned Sail: the same run that is proven is the run Sail has seen,
//! and a guest cannot pass its honest half without that agreement. When the
//! pinned oracle is absent the test skips visibly, naming the guest — which
//! is why callers place `proveAndVerify` as the *last* obligation of a test:
//! everything Sail-independent must already have been decided when the only
//! remaining exit is the skip.
//!
//! Attribution is separate and row-local, because "rejected" alone is not
//! evidence for the constraint under test. `attribute` reports *which* direct
//! constraint index or *which* lookup domain rejects a row, so a test can pin
//! the reason and fail if a sibling check happens to catch the forgery first.
//!
//! Runtime: about eleven seconds per end-to-end case on an M-series CPU — two
//! proofs of a nine-to-twelve instruction guest at three FRI queries. Row-local
//! attribution is milliseconds.
