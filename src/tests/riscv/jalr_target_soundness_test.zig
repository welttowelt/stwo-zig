//! A `JALR` whose committed jump target is not the one its source register and
//! immediate determine is rejected, and rejected *by* the binding that closed
//! the hole rather than incidentally.
//!
//! The guest. Five body instructions, of which four retire: three build
//! `x6 = TARGET - 4`, then `JALR x7, 4(x6)` jumps to the epilogue's first
//! instruction, skipping the fifth. `x10 = 7` is set before the jump and the
//! skipped instruction is `ADDI x10, x0, 99`, so the published output word is
//! the guest's own evidence that control transferred. `TARGET` is 4-aligned by
//! construction: this AIR requires a 4-aligned target, deliberately stricter
//! than RV32 JALR (which clears only bit 0), because a misaligned target is
//! refused before witness construction in this profile.
//!
//! Three forgeries, and their guards are not the same check.
//!
//! Forgery A — a non-byte source byte steers the jump. `rs1.next[1] = 256` is not
//! a byte, and 256 is invertible in M31, so `composeU32(rs1.next)` grows by
//! `256 * 256 = 2^16` and the target moves from `TARGET` to `TARGET + 2^16`,
//! outside the program entirely. The row stays coherent everywhere else: the
//! forged target is 4-aligned, its four limbs are bytes, its `target / 4` split
//! is inside the bounded low20/high8 window, and the byte-carry recurrence closes
//! because the non-byte limb behaves exactly like an honest carry —
//! `(256 + 0 + 0 - 0) / 256 = 1` is a legal carry bit. Every direct constraint
//! vanishes and the only obligation left is `rs1_middle_bytes`, so that
//! `range_check_8_8` request is what refuses the row.
//!
//! Forgery B — a flipped `to_pc_lsb` redirects the target by one. The old AIR
//! constrained `2 * to_pc_over_two + to_pc_lsb = rs1 + imm` and only bit-checked
//! `to_pc_lsb`, so it admitted a second assignment: flip the bit and claim
//! `target = rs1 + imm - 1`. That claim still satisfies the new byte-carry
//! recurrence — `target + bit0` composes to the same word — which is why the
//! recurrence is *not* what rejects it. What rejects it is the bounded
//! `target / 4 = low20 + 2^20 * high8` split. Every in-range pair
//! (`low20 < 2^20`, `high8 < 2^8`) makes `4 * (low20 + 2^20 * high8)` an integer
//! multiple of four below `2^30 < p`, and the forged target is odd, so no
//! in-range pair exists: the prover must commit the field quotient
//! `target * 4^-1 mod p`, far above `2^20`, and its `range_check_20` request is
//! out of table. This is the finding the module records: for the by-one redirect
//! the guard is a lookup, not a constraint.
//!
//! Forgery C — bit 0 alone. `to_pc_lsb` reaches no relation tuple at all, so
//! flipping it and touching nothing else leaves every lookup and every bus
//! request identical to the honest row and breaks only the four carry
//! constraints. That is the sharpest statement of the fix — bit 0 is derived,
//! not prover-chosen — and it is the one forgery here whose end-to-end rejection
//! is attributable, because nothing else about the row moved.
//!
//! What the end-to-end cases do and do not show. The honest half is the load
//! bearing one: before this file nothing in the repository proved a `jalr` row at
//! all, so a rejection test alone would also be satisfied by a guest that cannot
//! be proven. The forged halves prove the forged rows are refused in production,
//! and each is pinned to the stage its own fix lives at. Forgeries A and B leave
//! every direct constraint vanishing, so they reach a real proof and lose the
//! global LogUp closure: `.verification`. Forgery C breaks the carry recurrence
//! itself, so no proof exists: `.prover_constraints`. Only C is *attributable*
//! end to end, because only C moves no relation tuple; A and B also move this
//! row's `memory_access` tuple, so the stage they reach cannot separate the range
//! check from the memory argument. Row-local attribution is where the evidence
//! for A and B lives.
//!
//! Why row overrides. A single additive cell mutation cannot express any of
//! these rows: raising `rs1_next_1` alone breaks the read-only access binding
//! (`next == previous`) and the carry chain, so the row would be rejected with
//! the byte range deleted and the test would guard nothing. See
//! `prover/test_witness_hook.zig`.
//!
//! Runtime: about two minutes for the module — four row-local cases in
//! milliseconds and four proofs of a twelve-step guest at three FRI queries,
//! each about thirty seconds and dominated by the fixed-size preprocessed lookup
//! tables rather than by the guest. Bounded by construction: one committed
//! `jalr` row.
