//! A read-only register access must emit the value it consumed, and a `BEQ` row
//! that emits a different value is rejected *by* that binding.
//!
//! The bug this guards. A committed access carries `previous` and `next` as two
//! distinct column groups: the access chain consumes `previous` at
//! `previous_clock` and emits `next` at its derived ordered access clock, and
//! the opcode semantics compute on `next`. Nothing tied the two for a source
//! operand, so `next` was a
//! free prover choice that was *also* what the row wrote back into the register
//! cell. Every register-reading instruction therefore doubled as an arbitrary
//! register write. `common.readOnlyAccessConstraints` closes it by forcing
//! `next == previous` limbwise on every read-only access of all sixteen
//! register-touching families.
//!
//! Why `BEQ` is the vehicle. A branch writes no register at all —
//! `committed_row_layout.writtenSlot(.branch_eq)` is null, so *both* of its
//! accesses are read-only and neither `next` group is pinned by a destination
//! result. It is the cleanest possible demonstration: with the binding deleted a
//! `BEQ` still branches correctly and simultaneously stores a chosen word into
//! two registers.
//!
//! The two forgeries. The first is the confirmed exploit: the row consumes
//! `0xdeadb000` and emits `0x7f7f7f7f`. The second emits the non-byte limb
//! `1000000`. `branch_eq` byte-ranges nothing — its register limbs reach only
//! the `memory_access` bus — so row-locally a non-byte limb is admissible the
//! moment `next == previous` holds. That is the point: byte-ness of a register
//! value on that bus is *inductive*, supplied by the producing family that
//! byte-ranged its write, and the read-only binding is what stops a consuming
//! family from injecting a fresh non-byte word into the chain. The `div`
//! `lt_diff` bound and every other argument that assumes a consumed limb is a
//! byte rests on it.
//!
//! Both forgeries move the emitted limbs of *both* accesses, not just the one
//! register the exploit named. `BEQ`'s equality constraint compares the two
//! `next` groups limbwise, so a coherent forgery must move them together — which
//! makes the hole worse rather than harder to reach: one `BEQ` writes two
//! arbitrary words. Nothing else in either forged row moves.
//!
//! Attribution is row-local, and can only be row-local. Each row-local test
//! pins the failing constraint index and count through `harness.attribute` —
//! whose `.constraints` verdict already says a direct constraint and not a
//! preprocessed table rejected the row — and then shows the *counterfactual*:
//! re-applying the forged word to `previous` as well makes the row admissible
//! again, so the rejection is the read-only binding and not a sibling
//! constraint that happened to catch it.
//!
//! What the end-to-end test does and does not show. It proves that an honest
//! `branch_eq` row can be committed and proven at all — nothing in the
//! repository showed that before — and that both forged rows are refused in
//! production before a proof exists, which is the stage a direct-constraint fix
//! belongs at. It still cannot attribute that refusal to the read-only binding
//! specifically: every column that binding constrains is a `memory_access` tuple
//! element — `next` is the emitted tuple, `previous` the consumed one — so the
//! global memory argument would also reject these rows. The control test states
//! the scope of that as an executable fact rather than a caveat: an override of
//! `rs1_clock_prev`, which reaches no direct constraint of the family, is
//! row-locally admissible, does produce a proof, and is refused by the global
//! closure alone. So the two stages now separate a constraint fix from a bus
//! fix, and only the row-local tests separate this binding from the bus.
//!
//! Why a row override is required. A single additive mutation of `rs1_next_0`
//! also breaks the `BEQ` equality constraint, because `rs2_next_0` no longer
//! matches. That row is rejected whether or not the read-only binding exists, so
//! such a test would pass with the fix deleted and guard nothing.
//!
//! Runtime: milliseconds for the three row-local tests; about half a minute for
//! the control test; about a minute and a half for the end-to-end test, which
//! proves a thirteen-instruction guest once honestly and then twice more up to
//! the prover's constraint check.
