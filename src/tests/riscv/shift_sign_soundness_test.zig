//! A shift row may not choose its own sign fill: `SRL` may not claim one at all,
//! and `SRA` may only claim the sign bit its operand actually carries.
//!
//! The forgery. `SRL x10, x5, x6` with `x5 = 0x04030201` and `x6 = 8` honestly
//! commits `result = 0x00040302` and `rs1_sign = 0`. A prover instead claims
//! `rs1_sign = 1`, which by the `input > 3` sign-fill equation forces the vacated
//! high byte `result[3] = 255`, i.e. the whole word `0xFF040302`. Every other
//! shift equation still closes: the shift is a whole limb, so `bit_multiplier`
//! is one and the `input == 3` equation's `rs1_sign * (bit_multiplier - 1)`
//! coefficient vanishes — `rs1_sign` reaches nothing but limb 3. All four result
//! limbs stay bytes, so the `range_check_8_8` pairs over the result cannot see
//! it. The symmetric claim on `SRA x11, x5, x6` is the same three columns: the
//! operand is positive, so `rs1_sign = 1` is a lie about bit 31.
//!
//! Why the two halves are guarded differently. `is_srl` and `is_sra` enter the
//! shift equations only through their sum `right_shift`, so on a right-shift row
//! `rs1_sign` is the *only* column whose meaning differs between the two
//! opcodes. Nothing else can distinguish them, and consequently neither guard
//! covers both rows:
//!
//!  - `(1 - is_sra) * rs1_sign` is a direct constraint, and on the `SRL` row it
//!    is the only guard there is — the `signRangeLookup` request carries
//!    numerator `-is_sra`, so it is switched *off* there;
//!  - on the `SRA` row that direct constraint vanishes identically, and the
//!    `signRangeLookup` request into `range_check_m31` is the only guard: it
//!    offers `{0, rs1.next[3] - rs1_sign * 128}`, and the table bounds the
//!    second element by 128, so a claimed sign the operand does not carry asks
//!    for a tuple that does not exist.
//!
//! The row-local tests probe that split rather than assuming it: the `SRL` test
//! asserts the forged row asks `range_check_m31` for nothing at all, and the
//! `SRA` test asserts every direct constraint vanishes and the sign request is
//! the only failing obligation. They are where this file's attribution lives,
//! and each fix has its own: deleting `(1 - is_sra) * rs1_sign` makes the forged
//! `SRL` row admissible and collapses the two opcodes' constraint vectors onto
//! each other, failing the two `SRL` tests and neither `SRA` one; deleting the
//! `signRangeLookup` request makes the forged `SRA` row admissible and fails
//! only its test.
//!
//! What the end-to-end tests do and do not show. They show the forged rows are
//! *reachable* — committed by the production witness path and refused in
//! production — and that the honest guest they are derived from proves and
//! verifies. Each is now pinned to the stage its own guard lives at, and the two
//! differ, which is the end-to-end shadow of the split above. The `SRL` row
//! breaks the direct constraint `(1 - is_sra) * rs1_sign`, so no proof exists:
//! `.prover_constraints`. The `SRA` row satisfies every direct constraint — the
//! row-local test below asserts exactly that — so it reaches a real proof and
//! loses the global LogUp closure: `.verification`.
//!
//! Neither is full attribution. Both forgeries also move `rd_next_3`, an element
//! of the register access tuple this row offers `memory_access`, so the `SRA`
//! row's verification failure could equally be the memory argument rather than
//! the sign range. Attribution stays row-local; what the stage pin adds is that
//! a lookup fix and a constraint fix are no longer indistinguishable end to end.
//!
//! Columns the forgery moves that the bug description does not name.
//! `destinationResultConstraints` pins `rd.next = rd_nonzero * result`, so
//! forging `result[3]` forces `rd_next_3` too. It is moved only to keep the row
//! self-consistent: without it the row fails that binding instead and the
//! rejection would say nothing about the sign fill.
//!
//! Why the row override exists. A single additive cell mutation cannot express
//! this row: raising `rs1_sign` alone leaves `result[3] = 0` and breaks the
//! sign-fill equation, so the row would be rejected with the fix deleted and the
//! test would guard nothing. See `prover/test_witness_hook.zig`.
//!
//! Runtime: four row-local cases in milliseconds, three end-to-end cases at
//! about thirty seconds each — one proof of an eleven-instruction guest,
//! dominated by the fixed-size preprocessed lookup tables rather than by the
//! guest. Bounded by construction: two committed `shifts_reg` rows.
