//! A byte store may rewrite the byte it marked and nothing else, and the bytes
//! it leaves alone are rejected *by* the unmarked-byte preservation constraints.
//!
//! The bug. `SB`/`SH` commit the whole destination memory word as `dst.previous`
//! and `dst.next`, but the pinned Stark-V layout tied only the *marked* limbs of
//! `dst.next` to the stored data. The other three limbs of a byte store's target
//! word were therefore free prover choices that the memory access chain wrote
//! back, so `SB` doubled as an arbitrary three-byte write. The fix binds every
//! unmarked limb to `dst.previous`, gated on `is_sb + is_sh` so a full-word `SW`
//! keeps overwriting all four bytes.
//!
//! The guest. `SW` a known word to a data address, `SB` one byte into it, then
//! `LW` it back, so the byte store's effect on the *whole* word reaches public
//! output: the guest publishes `0x04035501`, which is the input word
//! `0x04030201` with byte 1 replaced. A row-local test alone cannot say the
//! forged row is reachable, so the last test proves the honest guest end to end
//! before forging it.
//!
//! The forgery. The `SB` row's committed `dst.next` limbs are replaced with
//! `0xCCBB55AA`: the marked limb keeps the honestly stored `0x55`, so the store
//! itself is still exactly what the program asked for, and the three unmarked
//! limbs carry the attacker's bytes. Nothing else moves — `dst_next_*` is the
//! only column block the forgery touches. That is deliberate and is what makes
//! the row-local rejection attributable: the marked-byte constraint, the
//! read-only bindings on `rs1` and `src`, the marker/shift witnesses, the
//! destination write-enable and the store's zero result witness are all
//! untouched and all still vanish, so the only obligations left to reject the
//! row are the four preservation constraints the fix added.
//!
//! Why attribution is row-local, and why the end-to-end half cannot supply it.
//! `dst.next` is not only witness: its limbs are elements of the `memory_access`
//! tuple the row offers the bus. So the forged row moves that bus as well as
//! breaking the four preservation constraints, and the global memory argument
//! would refuse it even with the fix deleted. Deleting the fix and rerunning
//! confirms it: the row-local tests below fail and this one still passes.
//! What the end-to-end stage does say is that the fix is a *direct constraint*:
//! the forged row never becomes a proof, where a forgery caught only by a
//! preprocessed table proves and loses at verification. Attribution to the
//! specific constraint lives entirely in the row-local tests, which name one
//! index per forged limb.
//!
//! Completeness. The same guest's `SW` row overwrites all four bytes of a word
//! that was previously zero. It is admissible, which is the evidence that the
//! `is_sb + is_sh` gate does not over-constrain a full-word store — every limb
//! of that row is unmarked, so an ungated preservation constraint would reject
//! it. The other half of that test forges the `SW` row to leave one byte at its
//! previous value and shows the *word* constraint still rejects it, so nothing
//! about `SW` was weakened either.
//!
//! Coverage this file does not claim. The gate is `is_sb + is_sh`; only the
//! `is_sb` half is exercised here, because the guest is deliberately the three
//! memory operations the bug needs and nothing more. `SH`'s two-limb marker set
//! relies on the same four constraints and on `semantics/load_store.zig`'s own
//! row-level test.
//!
//! Runtime: four tests in milliseconds, plus about a minute for the end-to-end
//! case, which proves a thirteen-instruction guest twice.
