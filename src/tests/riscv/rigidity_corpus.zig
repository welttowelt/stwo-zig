//! Honest committed rows for the witness-rigidity audit, sampled once and
//! charged against an explicit work budget.
//!
//! All three rigidity properties consume the same object: honest committed rows
//! of every opcode family, paired with the trace row that produced them.
//! Producing it is the expensive half — executing the ELF corpus and
//! materialising every family's committed columns — and it used to be paid once
//! per property. It is paid once here, across a thread pool, and the runner
//! traces are released as soon as the rows are copied out.
//!
//! The cheap half is the probes, and their cost is why this module exists
//! rather than a few constants in the test. A gate whose cost is a silent
//! function of corpus size stops being run, so every `row_admissibility` call
//! goes through a `Budget` with a stated ceiling and the realised count is
//! printed. Exceeding the ceiling raises — a cap that silently drops coverage
//! is worse than a slow gate.
//!
//! Two profiles, selected by the `riscv_rigidity_exhaustive` build option:
//!
//! - `fast` (default) samples a bounded number of rows per family, biased so
//!   that every opcode selector the corpus executes is represented, and gives
//!   the exhaustive `next`-limb byte sweep to the first row of each selector.
//!   A column is observable if ANY honest row makes it so and a byte sweep
//!   decides determinacy over the limb's whole domain, so distinct rows buy
//!   power and repeated rows buy almost none.
//! - `exhaustive` keeps the original bounds — a prefix of every family's
//!   materialised rows in every program, byte-swept once per program — so the
//!   slower sweep remains a faithful superset of what it always probed.
//!
//! # Where the honest rows come from
//!
//! Two sources, and the difference is what they can reach:
//!
//! - the committed ELF vectors below — real programs, which decide selector
//!   coverage and give the audits long dependent computations; and
//! - every case of the Sail-derived operand-class corpus
//!   (`operand_classes.zig`), wrapped by the guest fixture. The measured gap
//!   this closes: the ELF vectors leave 180 of the 270 enumerated
//!   (opcode, operand-class) pairs untouched — no zero divisor, no shift at
//!   the limb-alignment edges or mod-32 wrap, no MULH sign pair, no
//!   backward-taken branch outside `beq`, no byte-lane spread — so the
//!   rigidity probes were auditing rows whose operand structure a prover
//!   controls completely. Each class guest carries one distinguished row
//!   (its instruction under test); the sampler takes that row regardless of
//!   quota, the way it already takes novel selectors, because representing
//!   every class the corpus executes is the point of executing them.
//!
//! Class guests take the per-selector sweep policy under BOTH profiles: the
//! exhaustive profile's per-program sweep exists to stay a superset of what
//! it historically probed, and the class guests are new, so selector-bounded
//! sweeps add their coverage without multiplying the exhaustive tier's cost
//! by three hundred programs.
