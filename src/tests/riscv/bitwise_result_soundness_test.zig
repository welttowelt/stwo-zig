//! A bitwise R-type row may not choose its own result: nothing in the direct
//! constraints computes `XOR`, `OR` or `AND`, so the whole binding is one
//! `bitwise` table request per limb.
//!
//! What `base_alu_reg` actually constrains. Its twenty-nine direct constraints
//! are five opcode-flag bits and an activation bit, an ADD byte-carry chain
//! gated by `is_add`, a SUB chain gated by `is_sub`, the destination block, and
//! the read-only bindings on both sources. On a bitwise row both carry chains
//! are switched off, so `result` reaches *no* direct constraint at all. The
//! only obligations left on it are two `range_check_8_8` pairs, which say the
//! limbs are bytes and nothing more, and the four `bitwise` requests
//! `{rs1.next[i], rs2.next[i], result[i], operation_id}`, whose table holds a
//! row only where `result[i]` is the operation applied to the two operands.
//! Take the requests away and a bitwise instruction writes an arbitrary word.
//!
//! Why the destination is `x0`. `destinationResultConstraints` pins
//! `rd.next = rd_nonzero * result`, so on any ordinary row a forged `result`
//! must move `rd.next` too — and `rd.next` is an element of the `memory_access`
//! tuple, so the register bus moves with it and the global memory argument
//! rejects the row whatever the table does. With `rd = x0`, `rd_nonzero` is
//! zero, the destination block reads `rd.next = 0` independently of `result`,
//! and `result` is left with no constraint and no bus. `XOR x0, x5, x6` is a
//! legal RV32I instruction that retires an ordinary `base_alu_reg` row.
//!
//! That is what makes this the sweep's first end-to-end forgery whose rejection
//! is attributable. The row-local test asserts it directly: all three bus
//! fingerprints — `memory_access`, `registers_state`, `program_access` — are
//! bit-identical between the honest and the forged row, so nothing global can
//! tell them apart and the only relation the forgery moves is one `bitwise`
//! request that leaves its table.
//!
//! The forgery. `XOR x0, x5, x6` with `x5` the public input word and `x6 = 15`
//! honestly commits `result[0] = 0x0e`. The prover claims `0x0d` instead: still
//! a byte, so both `range_check_8_8` pairs stay in their table, and the row asks
//! the bitwise table for `{0x01, 0x0f, 0x0d, xor}`, which does not exist.
//!
//! Stage. Every direct constraint vanishes, so proving must succeed and
//! verification must fail: the dropped request's opcode-side fraction has
//! nothing to cancel against and the global LogUp sum is non-zero. See
//! `air/lookups/tables/source_ingest.zig`'s `UnrepresentableRequest` for why the
//! harness models the adversary that omits the impossible multiplicity rather
//! than the one that aborts its own prover.
//!
//! Adversarial self-check, executed 2026-07-27. `base_alu_reg.bitwiseLookupEnabler`
//! was made to return zero, switching every bitwise request off, and this module was
//! re-run. Real output:
//!
//!   4/14 ... the honest XOR row discards its result and is admissible...OK
//!   5/14 ... the forged result fails only the bitwise table and moves no bus...
//!        expected a bitwise rejection; the row is admissible
//!   6/14 ... the forged XOR result proves and loses at verification...FAIL
//!   11/14 base_alu_reg.test.x0 discards arithmetic and bitwise results...FAIL
//!   11 passed; 0 skipped; 3 failed.
//!
//! Both halves fail, which is what makes each a guard rather than coverage: without
//! the requests the forged row is admissible *and* its proof verifies. The AIR file
//! was then restored byte-for-byte (`git diff` empty) and the module re-run green.
//!
//! Runtime: two row-local cases in milliseconds; one end-to-end case at about a
//! minute, being one honest proof and verification of a ten-instruction guest
//! plus one forged proof and verification. Bounded by construction: one
//! committed `base_alu_reg` row.
