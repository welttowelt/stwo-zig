//! An `AUIPC` immediate carried in the second u32 decomposition of its own ROM
//! residue is rejected, and rejected *by* the low-limb pin rather than
//! incidentally.
//!
//! The identity. `2^32 = 2p + 2` for `p = 2^31 - 1`, so the u32 window holds two
//! preimages of every M31 residue: `w` and `w + (p + 2) = w + 0x80000001`. The
//! immediate is bound by `composeU32(imm_limbs) - imm_felt - imm_sign * 2 = 0`,
//! and `imm_sign` is tied only to bit 31 of `imm_limbs[3]` — a bit the prover
//! also chooses. The second preimage raises the residue by exactly
//! `p + 2 == 2 (mod p)`, which is exactly what flipping `imm_sign` to one
//! subtracts, so the binding closes on both preimages: it is circular. `AUIPC
//! x10, 0x2` at pc `0x1000c` therefore admits `imm_limbs = [0x01, 0x20, 0, 0x80]`
//! beside the honest `[0, 0x20, 0, 0]` for the same ROM word `imm_felt = 0x2000`,
//! and `rd` receives `0x8001200d` instead of `0x1200c`.
//!
//! Why the ROM lookup cannot catch it. `programLookup` offers
//! `(pc, opcode_id, rd_addr, imm_felt, 0)`. The alias moves none of those five:
//! it changes how the row *decomposes* a ROM word it still names honestly. The
//! third test below confirms the `program_access` fingerprint is byte-identical,
//! which is the whole reason a decoded-program lookup is no defence here.
//!
//! Why the sibling range checks cannot catch it either. `imm_limbs[3]` stays a
//! byte and the `range_check_m31` residual `imm_limbs[3] - 128 * imm_sign` is
//! `0x80 - 0x80 = 0`, so the pair the immediate offers that table is `(1, 0)` —
//! a legal row. The second test asserts that against the table's own index
//! function, so "only the pin rejects this" is executable rather than prose.
//!
//! What the forgery must move, and why none of it is extra freedom. Beyond
//! `imm_limbs` and `imm_sign` the row commits `result` and `rd_next`. Both are
//! *determined* by the aliased immediate: the four carry constraints pin
//! `result` to the bytewise sum `pc + imm`, and `destinationResultConstraints`
//! pins `rd_next` to `result` for a nonzero `rd`. Leaving either honest would
//! break the adder or the destination write, and the row would be refused with
//! the pin deleted — coverage-shaped, not coverage. `pc`, `pc_limbs`,
//! `imm_felt`, `rd_addr`, `rd_prev`, `rd_clock_prev`, `clock`, `enabler` and the
//! destination inverse are all untouched.
//!
//! Attribution is row-local, and only row-local. The fix is a direct constraint,
//! so the second test below pins the forged row's failure to that one constraint
//! index and to no other: delete the pin and the row becomes admissible, which is
//! what makes that test a guard.
//!
//! What the end-to-end test does and does not show. It shows that an honest
//! `auipc` row can be committed, proven and verified — coverage nothing in the
//! repository had — and that the forged row never yields a proof. It cannot
//! attribute that refusal to the pin: the aliased value *is* an element of `rd`'s
//! access tuple, which the third test measures, so the global memory argument
//! would refuse the row whatever the direct constraints say. What the stage does
//! say is that the low-limb pin is a *direct constraint* and not a lookup: the
//! forged row never becomes a proof, where a forgery caught only by a
//! preprocessed table proves and loses at verification instead. Deleting the pin
//! would move this test's stage, not just its verdict.
//!
//! Runtime: three row-local tests in milliseconds; one end-to-end test costing
//! about seventy-five seconds of CPU — an honest proof plus verification, then
//! one aborted proof of the same nine-instruction guest. Bounded by
//! construction: one committed `auipc` row.
