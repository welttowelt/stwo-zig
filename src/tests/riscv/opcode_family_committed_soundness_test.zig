//! End-to-end committed-row coverage for the eight previously unexercised
//! opcode families: `base_alu_imm`, `branch_lt`, `fence`, `jal`, `lt_imm`,
//! `lt_reg`, `mul`, and `shifts_imm`.
//!
//! LUI and MULH are ninth and tenth cases in this module for a different
//! reason. Their older CP-06 tests flip committed cells after interaction
//! generation. Those remain useful prover-consistency checks, but they are
//! weaker than the pre-ingestion `.main_row` adversary used here: these tests
//! replace production rows before lookup multiplicities and the interaction
//! trace are derived.
//!
//! Each case reads its honest row from the production witness generator,
//! attributes a semantic forgery locally where that is possible, requires the
//! forged committed pipeline to reject it, and finally proves and verifies the
//! honest guest. Writes target x0 wherever the family permits it. That leaves
//! the architectural buses byte-identical and makes the direct constraint or
//! range-table request named by the test the only possible rejection.
//!
//! FENCE and LUI are the deliberate program-binding cases. Their forged
//! decoded fields are row-locally admissible and are bound to the fetched
//! instruction exclusively by `program_access`. Both tests isolate the changed
//! program-bus fingerprint and pin rejection to verification.
