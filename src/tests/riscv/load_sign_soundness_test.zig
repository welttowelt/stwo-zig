//! A signed load whose committed sign witness is cleared is rejected, and
//! rejected *by* the sign residual range check rather than by any constraint.
//!
//! The forgery. The guest stores the byte `0x80` and loads it back with `LB`,
//! so the honest row commits `src_msb = 1` and
//! `result = [0x80, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff]` — the register receives `0xffffff80`. A
//! prover instead claims `src_msb = 0`. That zeroes
//! `signed_mask = is_signed * src_msb * 255`, which is the only value the three
//! sign-extension limbs are equated to, so the row may carry
//! `result = [0x80, 0, 0, 0]`: the register receives `0x80`, which is what
//! `LBU` computes. The `LH` case is the same forgery one limb up — the honest
//! halfword `0x8000` loads as `[0x00, 0x80, 0xff, 0xff]` and the forged row
//! claims `[0x00, 0x80, 0, 0]`, turning `LH` into `LHU`.
//!
//! Why attribution is the whole point. Every direct constraint still vanishes.
//! `src_msb = 0` is a bit, so `bit(src_msb)` holds. `(1 - is_signed) * src_msb`
//! holds because `is_signed` is one for `LB` and `LH`. The sign-extension
//! equalities hold because both of their sides moved together, the selected
//! byte is untouched, and every forged limb is still a byte, so no downstream
//! byte range sees anything unusual. That is why an early constraints-only
//! probe reported this hole as still open after it had been closed. The check
//! that refuses the row is the seven-bit residual `result[0] - src_msb * 128`
//! (`result[1]` for `LH`) requested into `range_check_m31`: with `src_msb = 0`
//! the residual is the whole sign byte, `128`, and `range_check_m31` admits a
//! second tuple element only below `128`. So the row-local tests assert both
//! halves — `evaluate` returns all zero, and the *only* failing obligation is
//! that request. Delete the two `entry.rangeM31` requests
//! `opcode_entries.loadStore` emits and those assertions fail, because the
//! forged row becomes admissible.
//!
//! Columns the forgery moves that the bug description does not name.
//! `dst.next` is pinned to `result` by `destinationResultConstraints` for every
//! load that writes a register, so the written register's sign-extension limbs
//! move with the result limbs. This is forced, not chosen: a row whose
//! `result` and `dst.next` disagree fails that direct constraint and would be
//! refused whatever the range check does — which is exactly the coverage-shaped
//! outcome a single-cell mutation produces here.
//!
//! What the end-to-end tests do and do not show. A row-local verdict does not
//! say a signed-load row can be committed and proven at all; the honest proof
//! below is that half, and it is the reason the two rejection tests are not
//! vacuous. The rejections themselves are reachability evidence, not
//! attribution, for two independent reasons.
//!
//!  - `dst.next` limbs are elements of the register access tuples this row
//!    offers to `memory_access`, so the forgery moves that bus and the global
//!    memory argument refuses the row whatever the sign residual does. No
//!    end-to-end forgery of this fix can avoid that: the sign-extension limbs
//!    are the register write. Deleting both `signRangeLookups` requests leaves
//!    the two end-to-end tests passing and fails only the row-local ones, which
//!    is the measured statement of where the guard lives.
//!  - The stage is now the one the fix belongs at, which is a weaker statement
//!    than it sounds. Both forgeries leave every direct constraint vanishing, so
//!    they reach a real proof and lose the global LogUp closure:
//!    `.verification`. That separates a lookup fix from a constraint fix, but it
//!    cannot separate *this* lookup from the register bus the same override
//!    moves. Pinning it rather than `.any` still keeps the tests honest about
//!    which half of the pipeline rejects.
