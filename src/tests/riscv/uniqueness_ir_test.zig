//! Emits each opcode family's per-row constraint system as uniqueness IR, and
//! proves the emission is faithful.
//!
//! `Semantics(S)` is generic over its scalar, so instantiating it with a tracing
//! scalar records the exact polynomials the committed AIR evaluates rather than
//! a transcription of them. That is the whole point: a hand-written model of an
//! AIR is correct the day it is written and verifies a system you no longer ship
//! a week later, and a solver result about a drifted model is worse than no
//! result because it reads as assurance.
//!
//! Extraction alone does not earn that, though. A tracing scalar that dropped a
//! term, mis-ordered a subtraction, or interned two distinct nodes as one would
//! emit a system that is *easier* to satisfy uniquely, and every family would
//! come back UNSAT. So the differential below is not a nicety attached to the
//! extractor; it is the reason any UNSAT verdict downstream means anything.
//! It evaluates the emitted DAG and `Semantics(QM31)` at the same fixed-seed
//! random assignments and requires them equal constraint by constraint.
//!
//! Two things beyond the constraint system are emitted, and both exist because
//! a query built from committed columns alone answers a weaker question than it
//! appears to. `next_pc` is an alias column recovered from the state-chain
//! request, without which no family is ever asked where it jumps. A declared
//! `domain` records the range and alignment an input really has, which keeps the
//! solver out of regions no execution reaches -- an assumption, and the only one
//! here that can hide a bug, so each carries its justification into the IR.
//!
//! Runtime: ~1 s. Emission is comptime-driven and the differential is
//! `FAMILIES x TRIALS` DAG walks over base-field arithmetic; neither proves
//! anything, so neither is slow.

//                     (`state_chain.zig` MAX_CLOCK_DIFF), and the row already
//                     emits that as a range_check_20 request the query models.
