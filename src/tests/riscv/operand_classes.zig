//! Query surface over the Sail-derived operand-class corpus.
//!
//! `operand_class_corpus/*.zig` holds, for every opcode, the operand
//! classes the ISA admits and the AIR's structure distinguishes -- sign
//! boundaries, carry chains, zero divisors, shift decomposition edges,
//! alignment lanes, x0 patterns, backward control flow -- each as a
//! self-contained instruction body plus the architectural result the
//! pinned Sail model produced for it. `scripts/riscv_operand_classes.py`
//! documents the derivation, generates the data, and `check`s committed
//! data against regeneration; nothing here re-derives semantics.
//!
//! A coverage test asks for cases instead of hand-picking words:
//!
//!   const srl8 = operand_classes.only(.SRL, .shift_eight);
//!   for (operand_classes.all) |case| ...
//!
//! Bodies obey the guest fixture's register discipline (never x1-x5, only
//! x6/x7/x10/x28-x31), define every register and memory byte they read,
//! and keep control flow inside the body, so `guest_elf_fixture.build`
//! can wrap any of them unchanged. pc-relative expectations are stored as
//! offsets from the retiring pc; `RowCheck.expectedRdValue` re-anchors
//! them at the body's actual placement.
