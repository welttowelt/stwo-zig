//! RISC-V STARK proving orchestration.
//!
//! Proves execution of a RISC-V RV32IM program by:
//! 1. Running the program (ELF) to produce an execution trace
//! 2. Splitting the trace by opcode family
//! 3. Creating per-family components, each at its own log_size
//! 4. Committing and proving via the stwo STARK backend
//! 5. Verification of the produced proof
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! Instead of one monolithic component with all trace rows, the trace is split
//! by opcode family. Each active family gets its own component with its own
//! `log_size = ceil(log2(count))`. This gives smaller FFTs per-component and
//! better cache behavior.
//!
//! ## Stages
//!
//! `proveStages` owns nothing but sequencing. Each stage lives in the module
//! named after the artefact it owns, and the order below is protocol order --
//! a transcript is a total order over these calls, so moving one is a different
//! proof even when every witness value is identical:
//!
//! | stage | module |
//! |-------|--------|
//! | commitment witness (memory, program, Merkle, Poseidon2) | `commitment_witness.zig` |
//! | statement and shard geometry | `statement_geometry.zig` |
//! | tree 0: preprocessed columns | `preprocessed.zig` |
//! | tree 1: main trace | `main_trace.zig` |
//! | claim phase and tree 2: interactions | `interaction_trace.zig` |
//! | components and proof assembly | `proof_finalize.zig` |
//!
//! ## Storage
//!
//! Every protocol-capacity-sized value -- statement, opcode column buffers,
//! interaction scratch, prover components borrowed by `core` -- lives in one
//! heap `ProofWorkspace` per proof (see `proof_workspace.zig`). `proveStages`
//! returns `!void` and publishes through an out-pointer so the large proof
//! output costs one frame slot at the boundary instead of one per
//! error-propagation site inside the stages.
//!
//! ## Usage
//! ```zig
//! const result = try proveRiscVWithEngine(
//!     Engine, allocator, config, &exec_trace, &state_chain, &rw_memory, null,
//! );
//! try verifyRiscVWithEngine(Engine, allocator, config, result.statement, result.proof, result.interaction_claim);
//! ```
