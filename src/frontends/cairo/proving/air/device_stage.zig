//! The Cairo half of the whole-stage device composition hook.
//!
//! `prover/air/device_composition.zig` declares a backend-neutral stage that a
//! proof may carry on its `ProveOptions`. This file implements that stage for
//! captured Cairo AIR programs and delegates the device work to an injected
//! `Device`, which is supplied by `integrations/cairo_metal` — the one module
//! that may name both the Cairo bundle and the Metal runtime.
//!
//! ## Why the loop lives here and not in the integration
//!
//! Byte-exactness of the composition polynomial is a property of the
//! *accumulator*, not of the kernels: `DomainEvaluationAccumulator.columns`
//! hands out random-coefficient powers from the tail of the powers vector, and
//! the host paths consume them strictly in component order
//! (`component_parallel.compute` walks `power_cursor` down the same order that
//! `computeCompositionEvaluationSequential` walks `columns` up). Reproducing
//! that assignment is the load-bearing part of the hook, so it is written once,
//! here, next to the host evaluator it has to agree with — and the same loop
//! runs both device-evaluated and host-evaluated components, which is what
//! makes a per-component refusal safe.
//!
//! ## Admission and fallback, stated as the two different things they are
//!
//! - **Whole-stage admission** happens once, in `Device.open`, before any
//!   evaluation: the metallib must authenticate, and the eval arena must plan.
//!   A refusal returns `null` and this file is never entered — the proof runs
//!   the unchanged host stage.
//! - **Per-component eligibility** is decided inside the same `open` call and
//!   reported as `Session.accepts`. A component whose kernels are not in the
//!   authenticated library (all-opcodes has three that the checked-in bundle
//!   does not carry) or whose shape the arena contract cannot express is
//!   evaluated on the host *inside* the device stage. That is not a fallback,
//!   it is the stage's declared coverage, and it is counted separately.
//! - A device error raised during evaluation is converted to a host evaluation
//!   of that one component and counted as a fallback, so a proof that hit one
//!   cannot report `accelerated_without_fallbacks`.
