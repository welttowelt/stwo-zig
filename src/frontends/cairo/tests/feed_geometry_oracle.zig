//!
//! These live in the frontend test root rather than beside the resolver because
//! `zig build addTest` only collects tests from its root module's own files;
//! tests inside the `cairo_frontend` dependency module compile but never run.
//!
//! The parity claim under test is the one the arena activation depends on: the
//! log sizes `feed_geometry_oracle` computes from the adapted prover input alone
//! are *bit-identical* to the ones the witness-to-statement handoff
//! (`OwnedClaimGeometry.resolveFeedGeometry`) produces after execution. The
//! reference here is not this repository's own measurement but the pinned
//! official claim summary vector, so a drift in either the resolver or the
//! topology fails the test.
