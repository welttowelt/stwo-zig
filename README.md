`stwo-zig` is a parity-first port of [StarkWare's Stwo](https://github.com/starkware-libs/stwo).
It brings Stwo's circle-STARK protocol to Zig while making memory, vectorization, and device
execution explicit. The result is one proving stack: pure Stwo with native examples today,
and the Cairo frontend (stwo-cairo in Zig) when that effort resumes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The [pinned Rust Stwo revision](conformance/upstream.md) is the final correctness oracle.
> Gated proofs cross-verify in both directions: Rust to Zig and Zig to Rust.

## Backends

| Backend | Execution model | Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Zig CPU / SIMD** | Portable scalar backend with hardware-native SIMD hot paths | Predictable execution and broad compatibility |
| **Metal** | Persistent resident runtime for Apple GPUs | Device-only production proofs with exact runtime identity |
| **CUDA** | Unavailable product descriptors only | No release-gated implementation or implicit selection |

## Frontends

| Surface | Current status |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native Stwo** | Blake, Poseidon, Plonk, state-machine, wide-Fibonacci, and XOR AIRs |
| **Cairo** | Versioned PIE ingestion and SN2-specialized resident proof machinery, parked until the stwo-cairo effort resumes; the general Cairo proof path is not release-gated |
| **RISC-V** | Release-gated Stark-V RV32IM ELF adapter with sharded AIR components, CPU proving, independent verification, and pinned-Rust oracle evidence |

## Quick Start

Requires **Zig 0.15.x** and **Python 3**. Rust parity tooling uses
`nightly-2025-07-14`.

```sh
zig build test-stwo-core -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
zig build test-stwo-prover -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
zig build test-native-cpu-product -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
zig build test-native-metal -Doptimize=ReleaseFast  # macOS with Metal
```

### Product support

| Product | Host | State |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `stwo-core` / `stwo-prover` | Zig-supported hosts | Released focused libraries |
| `stwo-native-cpu` | Zig-supported hosts | Released CPU/SIMD CLI |
| `stwo-native-metal` | macOS with Apple Metal | Parity-gated, source-JIT, device-only CLI |
| `stwo-zig` | Zig-supported hosts | Released CPU aggregate; Metal only with `-Daggregate-metal=true` on macOS |
| `stwo-zig-riscv-cpu` | Native host; static x86_64 Linux artifact | Release-gated RV32IM prove, verify, and benchmark CLI |
| Cairo products | No production host | Deferred until the separate Rust-oracle semantic goal resumes |
| CUDA products | No production host | Explicitly unavailable; no fallback or placeholder execution |

Library consumers can select the smallest public module they need:

| Import | Contract |
| :--- | :--- |
| `stwo_core` | Fields, circle domains, transcript, proof types, and verification |
| `stwo_prover` | `core`, backend contracts, and the backend-generic prover |
| `stwo` | Aggregate compatibility SDK |

```zig
const stwo_zig = b.dependency("stwo_zig", .{ .target = target, .optimize = optimize });
root.addImport("stwo_core", stwo_zig.module("stwo_core"));
root.addImport("stwo_prover", stwo_zig.module("stwo_prover"));
```

`zig build stwo-core` and `zig build stwo-prover` compile the focused library
surfaces without installing unrelated executables. Their corresponding
`test-stwo-*` steps include transitive purity and external-consumer gates.

The root build is a compatibility dispatcher. Product construction lives under
`build_support/products/`, backend integration under `build_support/backends/`,
benchmarks under `build_support/benchmarks/`, and policy under
`build_support/gates/`. The default install contains only the CPU aggregate CLI;
Metal enters that aggregate only with `-Daggregate-metal=true`. Machine-readable
build contracts are available through `product-matrix-identity`,
`identity-stwo-{core,prover,zig}`, and `build-configure-closure`.

## Prove

Build the focused CPU product, produce one self-verified proof, then verify its
versioned Rust-compatible artifact in a separate invocation:

```sh
zig build stwo-native-cpu -Doptimize=ReleaseFast

zig-out/bin/stwo-zig-native-cpu prove \
  --example xor --log-size 12 --protocol secure \
  --proof-artifact-out proof.json

zig-out/bin/stwo-zig-native-cpu verify \
  --artifact proof.json --protocol secure
```

`bench` uses the same proving transaction and verifies every warmup and timed
sample. `stwo-zig-native-metal` admits only its exact source-JIT identity and
fails rather than entering a CPU commitment path. Run `applications` on any
CLI for its compiled capability registry.

Native workloads default to the conservative `standard` resource profile
(2^25 committed cells, 512 MiB admission-accounted memory). Large evidence is
an explicit opt-in: pass `--resource-profile large` to admit at most 2^27
committed cells and 2 GiB accounted memory. The large profile admits wide
Fibonacci `--log-n-rows 20 --sequence-len 100`, but still rejects log22 x100
and maximum-width shapes. Report schema v7 records the selected profile,
checked geometry, accounting factor, and both budgets so benchmark evidence is
independently auditable.

## RISC-V frontend

The release-gated adapter accepts an RV32IM ELF, executes it, builds the sharded witness, proves it through
the same PCS/FRI core, self-verifies before publication, and emits a bounded schema-v3 artifact.
A separate process must verify that artifact against a caller-supplied expected-statement digest.
The pinned Rust [Stark-V](https://github.com/ClementWalter/stark-v) implementation remains the final
oracle at shared boundaries. Published artifacts carry the immutable `release_gated` status.

```sh
zig build stwo-zig -Doptimize=ReleaseFast

zig-out/bin/stwo-zig prove \
  --elf vectors/riscv_elfs/branch_fib.elf \
  --backend cpu --protocol functional \
  --output riscv-proof.json --report-out riscv-report.json

STATEMENT_DIGEST=$(python3 -c \
  'import json; print(json.load(open("riscv-report.json"))["statement_sha256"])')
zig-out/bin/stwo-zig verify \
  --artifact riscv-proof.json --protocol functional \
  --expect-statement-digest "$STATEMENT_DIGEST"
```

`functional` is the fast development profile. Use `secure` when collecting release evidence.

```sh
zig build test-riscv -Doptimize=ReleaseFast         # runner + trace suites
zig build test-riscv-prover -Doptimize=ReleaseFast  # prove + verify roundtrips
zig build riscv-bench -Doptimize=ReleaseFast        # CPU benchmark CLI
zig build riscv-metal-bench -Doptimize=ReleaseFast  # Metal commitments CLI (macOS)
zig build riscv-trace-dump -Doptimize=ReleaseFast   # trace dumper for equivalence runs
```

Run the same standard gate used by hosted CI:

```sh
python3 scripts/ci.py
```

For release evidence, use `python3 scripts/ci.py --strict`. Enable the versioned fast pre-commit
and product-scoped pre-push checks once per checkout with:

```sh
python3 scripts/install_hooks.py
```
