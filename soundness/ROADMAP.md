# RV32IM zkVM soundness roadmap

This roadmap tracks assurance beyond ordinary feature completeness. The
normative architectural model is pinned Sail RISC-V; Spike is an independent
executor, and the pinned RISC-V Architectural Tests provide the standards
corpus. Stark-V is retained only as a non-normative historical layout and
performance reference; it is not a release or correctness authority.

The two obligations stay separate:

1. **Semantic refinement:** every admitted retirement has the Sail-defined
   decode, state transition, memory effect, and next PC.
2. **Computational integrity:** an accepting proof forces that retirement
   sequence and its public program, input, output, roots, and completion state.

## Current assurance baseline — 2026-07-26

- [x] Exact Sail model, compiler, configuration, and transport patch are
      machine-pinned and reproducibly verified.
- [x] Exact Spike and architectural-test revisions are machine-pinned.
- [x] Canonical retirement comparison covers PC, word, register write, next PC,
      and memory effect with no PC normalization.
- [x] The deterministic positive/negative corpus passes live Sail and Spike
      comparison, including strict illegal/reserved/misaligned rejection.
- [x] That live differential is wired as a fail-closed CI gate
      (`scripts/riscv_sail_gate.py`): the committed evidence must bind to the
      committed corpus and pins on every PR, semantics-bearing changes must
      re-derive it against freshly verified pinned Sail/Spike, and toolchain
      unavailability is red, never a skip
      (`conformance/riscv-sail-differential-gate.md`).
- [x] All applicable upstream RV32I and RV32M architectural tests use
      Sail-generated signatures and pass the zkVM executor.
- [x] Every applicable architectural test follows execute → secure prove →
      separate-process verify in the formal audit.
- [x] MULH, MULHSU, and MULHU are admitted. Signed high multiplication binds
      both operand sign bits and the complete byte/carry recurrence.
- [x] MULH malicious-witness mutations are rejected at proof admission.
- [x] FENCE is admitted for the single-hart zkVM; FENCE.I remains an explicit,
      conservative profile exclusion.
- [x] Misaligned instruction targets and data accesses reject before state
      mutation and are constrained at the AIR boundary.
- [x] CPU/SIMD and Metal consume the same backend-neutral witness/AIR; Metal has
      no CPU fallback.
- [x] Completion is a public relation event, artifact schema v4 binds protocol
      and exact PCS geometry, and independent verification recomputes the
      decoded-program root from the supplied ELF.

The reproducible commands and evidence schemas live in
`scripts/riscv_formal_tools.py`, `scripts/riscv_trace_vectors.py`,
`scripts/riscv_arch_tests.py`, and `conformance/riscv/`.

## Closed under-constraints — 2026-07-26

Six demonstrated under-constraints in the opcode AIR were found by adversarial
review and closed. Each was inherited from the pinned Stark-V layout, so the
fixes are an intentional divergence recorded in `conformance/divergence-log.md`.

Every fix has a row-local rejection check. Five of the six have one in the
owning AIR module. The DIV divisor byte range does not: `semantics/div.zig`
covers only the quotient-sign and zero-divisor halves of that item, and the
divisor byte-range check lives in
`src/tests/riscv/divisor_byte_range_soundness_test.zig`. The committed-trace
coverage of all six, and what it does and does not establish, is the table
below.

- [x] Read-only accesses bind `next == previous`. Previously a source register's
      emitted bus value was a free prover choice that was also the operand the
      AIR computed on, so any register-reading instruction — a branch included —
      could rewrite the register file with an arbitrary word.
- [x] `SB`/`SH` preserve the unmarked bytes of the destination word.
- [x] `AUIPC` pins `imm_limbs[0] == 0`. Because `2^32 = 2p + 2`, every immediate
      previously admitted a second byte decomposition offset by `p + 2`.
- [x] `JALR` binds all source bytes, the signed I-immediate, bit 0, and the
      aligned target through an exact byte-carry recurrence. Its committed
      `target / 4` low20/high8 split mirrors the program AIR and enforces the
      successful-retirement address bound locally, including u32 wraparound.
- [x] `DIV`/`DIVU`/`REM`/`REMU` byte-range every divisor limb locally, bind the
      ambiguous signed zero-quotient sign while preserving the signed-overflow
      algebraic convention, and pin the zero-divisor convention. The sign
      request is inactive for unsigned operations, whose direct equations
      already pin `q_sign = 0`; this keeps bit-31-set DIVU/REMU quotients
      complete. All 292 Sail-derived operand-class rows are admitted by the
      row oracle and enter the rigidity corpus, and the original
      `0x8abcdef1 / 1` DIVU finding now proves and verifies end to end. The
      proven-sufficient `lt_diff` RC_20 bound is unchanged.
- [x] `LB`/`LH` sign extension and `SRL`/`SRA` sign fill bind their sign
      witnesses to the operand bit they claim to represent.

The sweep's previously global DIV byte-ness and JALR target-bit obligations are
now row-local. No known residual obligation from that sweep rests solely on bus
closure or the consuming ROM row.

The review that found these is the reason expanding committed-witness mutation
coverage (under "Continuing adversarial work") became a top soundness task
rather than one of several parallel ones: every one of the six was invisible to
the Sail differential (which validates the runner, not the AIR) and to the
retired CP-11 comparison (which compared against the layout containing the
same omissions).

## Committed-trace coverage of the six fixes — 2026-07-26

A row-local verdict says the AIR would reject a row. It does not say the row is
reachable through the committed pipeline, and "rejected" alone is not evidence
for the constraint under test. The seven modules below add the reachability half
where they can. The column that decides whether a test is a guard or merely
coverage is "attribution": an end-to-end case marked "no" still passes with its
fix deleted.

Every end-to-end entry means both halves — the guest proves and verifies
honestly, then the same guest with one committed row overridden does not.

**What the end-to-end stage now distinguishes, and what it still cannot.** The
committed-row override is applied to `workspace.opcode_columns` before
`lookup_sources.ingest`, so the multiplicity counters, the interaction trace and
the committed main trace are all derived from the forged witness. A forged row is
therefore refused by the AIR or by the LogUp closure, and no longer by the prover
disagreeing with itself. The stage pin became meaningful as a result: a fix that
lives in a direct constraint stops the row before a proof exists
(`.prover_constraints`), and a fix that lives in a lookup request lets the row
prove and loses the global sum (`.verification`). Deleting the fix moves the
stage, so the pin is now a real discriminator between the two kinds of fix.

It is still not full attribution for most of the six. The end-to-end stage says
*which half of the pipeline* rejects, not *which relation*: five of the six
forgeries also move a `memory_access` tuple element, so the global memory
argument would reject them even with the fix deleted. Only a forgery that moves
no bus can attribute end to end — `jalr_target_soundness_test.zig`'s bit-0 case
(`.prover_constraints`) and `bitwise_result_soundness_test.zig`
(`.verification`), which is why the latter exists. Row-local attribution remains
the load-bearing assertion everywhere else.

A modelling choice this rests on, recorded because it points one way. A forged
row whose lookup tuple is not in its table cannot be ingested by the honest
prover: there is no multiplicity row to increment.
`source_ingest.UnrepresentableRequest` lets the harness model the adversary that
hand-builds its multiplicity column and simply omits the impossible request; the
omitted fraction is what makes the global sum non-zero. Production still rejects
such a request as the prover bug it would be. So a `.verification` verdict is a
statement about the strongest adversary, not about the honest pipeline aborting.

| Closed item | Row-local check | End-to-end committed-trace test | Stage | Attribution asserted | Self-check reported |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Read-only `next == previous` | `semantics/{base_alu_imm,base_alu_reg,branch_eq,branch_lt,lt_imm,lt_reg,shifts_reg,load_store,div,mul,jalr}.zig`; `read_only_access_soundness_test.zig` | `read_only_access_soundness_test.zig`, `branch_eq` guest | `.prover_constraints`; the bus-only control reaches `.verification` | row-local only | yes |
| `SB`/`SH` unmarked bytes | `semantics/load_store.zig`; `partial_store_soundness_test.zig` | `partial_store_soundness_test.zig`, `load_store` guest (`SB`, `SW`, `LW`) | `.prover_constraints` | row-local only | yes |
| `AUIPC` `imm_limbs[0] == 0` | `semantics/auipc.zig`; `auipc_alias_soundness_test.zig` | `auipc_alias_soundness_test.zig`, `auipc` guest | `.prover_constraints` | row-local only | yes |
| `JALR` target binding | `semantics/jalr.zig`; `jalr_target_soundness_test.zig` | `jalr_target_soundness_test.zig`, `jalr` guest, three forgeries | `.verification` for the two range-check forgeries, `.prover_constraints` for bit 0 | row-local, **and end-to-end for the bit-0 forgery** | yes |
| DIV divisor byte range | `divisor_byte_range_soundness_test.zig` only — **not** `semantics/div.zig` | `divisor_byte_range_soundness_test.zig`, `div` guest — both halves green | `.verification` | row-local only | **no record** |
| `LB`/`LH`, `SRL`/`SRA` sign witnesses | `semantics/load_store.zig`, `semantics/shift_common.zig`; `load_sign_soundness_test.zig`, `shift_sign_soundness_test.zig` | `load_sign_soundness_test.zig` (`load_store` guest), `shift_sign_soundness_test.zig` (`shifts_reg` guest) | `.verification`, except the `SRL` direct constraint at `.prover_constraints` | row-local only | yes |

No forged row anywhere in this sweep produced a proof that verified. The rows now
pinned at `.verification` do produce a proof, which is the point: they are the
forgeries whose only guard is a preprocessed lookup, and a proof that fails the
global LogUp closure is exactly the shape that fix has.

"Self-check reported" means the module records an executed run with its real
output in which the specific constraint or lookup request was disabled, the
row-local attribution assertion failed because the forged row became admissible,
and the AIR file was then restored byte-for-byte. That is what makes the
row-local column a guard. Five of those six modules also report, unprompted,
that their end-to-end case still passes with the fix disabled; only
`jalr_target_soundness_test.zig`'s bit-0 case fails when its carry constraints
are deleted, and it is the only end-to-end guard in the sweep.

That "still passes with the fix disabled" asymmetry has not been re-measured
since the harness fix and should not be assumed to survive it: those runs were
recorded when every `.main_row` forgery was refused by the prover disagreeing
with itself, which is a rejection no fix can influence. Each affected module's
self-check needs re-running before its end-to-end line can be read as a guard.

What has changed is that the stage is now decided by the AIR. Every fix above
except the JALR bit-0 witness constrains a value that is also a bus tuple
element, so the *relation* that rejects still cannot be isolated end to end and
attribution stays row-local. But `.verification` is reachable, so the tests now
separate a constraint fix from a lookup fix, and
`bitwise_result_soundness_test.zig` shows the remaining gap is about bus
overlap and not about the harness: its forgery moves no bus, and its end-to-end
rejection is attributable to one preprocessed table.

Several of those modules say in their own doc comments that nothing in the
repository previously proved a row of their family end to end. Read that as
"no test under `src/tests/riscv/` did", and not even that for `branch_eq` and
`load_store`: `prover_test.zig` already proves and verifies BEQ, BNE, `LW`, and
`SW` rows, and `scripts/riscv_arch_tests.py` already runs execute → prove →
separate-process verify over the pinned architectural corpus, which exercises
every one of the six families. What the honest halves add is a *guest the forged
half is derived from*, which is what keeps the rejection from being vacuous —
not first-ever coverage of the family.

## Per-row witness uniqueness — 2026-07-27

The property, and exactly it: for one active row of one opcode family, any two
witness assignments that satisfy the family's direct constraints and its
preprocessed-table memberships and that agree on the architectural inputs must
agree on the architectural outputs. Inputs are the instruction identity (pc,
opcode selectors, operand indexes, immediates) and the consumed accesses'
`previous` limbs and clocks; outputs are the written access's `next` limbs,
`result_*`, a branch's decision and target, and the state-chain `next_pc`. Bus
relations (`program_access`, `memory_access`, `registers_state`) are outside
the modelled system, identically on both sides of every verdict below.

The instrument chain, each link executed rather than assumed:

* `src/tests/riscv/uniqueness_ir_test.zig` emits each family's constraints and
  lookup requests by instantiating the production `Semantics(S)`/`Entries(S)`
  with a tracing scalar, and a fixed-seed differential (17 families x 32
  trials, seed 0x51501ce01dedbeef) checks the emitted DAG against
  `Semantics(QM31)` constraint by constraint.
* `scripts/air_uniqueness_board.py` decides the two-copy query per family,
  sharded by opcode, with an honest-witness probe so an `unsat` cannot be
  vacuous silently.
* `src/tests/riscv/uniqueness_counterexample_test.zig` replays every exported
  `sat` pair against `row_admissibility.verdict` — the AIR's own direct
  constraints plus real preprocessed-table membership — so a solver-model
  artifact cannot be reported as an AIR bug. All three pairs exported by the
  first board were re-accepted by the oracle, which is what separated the two
  findings below.

Pre-fix board at a 120 s/shard budget: 13 families unique and non-vacuous
(`auipc`, `base_alu_imm`, `base_alu_reg`, `branch_eq`, `branch_lt`, `fence`,
`jal`, `jalr`, `load_store`, `lt_imm`, `lt_reg`, `lui`, `mul`), 2 `sat`
(`shifts_imm`, `shifts_reg`, deciding shard SRA in both, SLL/SRL shards still
open), 2 `timeout` (`div`, all four shards and its honest probe open; `mulh`,
all three shards open). Verdicts at a budget are budget- and run-dependent:
`base_alu_imm`, `base_alu_reg` and `mul` were `unknown` on an earlier run of
the same budget and closed on this one; a `timeout` is not a property.

**The seventh demonstrated under-constraint — CLOSED.** The pinned shift
carry window admitted carries the recurrence never produces.
`shift_common.carryRangePairs` sent only
`(bit_multiplier - 1) - carry_i` to an 8-bit box, so a live row admitted
`carry_i` anywhere in `[bit_multiplier - 256, bit_multiplier - 1]`, while
honest carries live in `[0, bit_multiplier - 1]`. The negative half of that
window moved an architectural write: for `SRA rd, x0, 31`,
`result[0] * 128 = rs1[3] - carries[3]`, and `carries[3] = -128` bought
`result[0] = 1` from a zero operand. No bus tuple carried the witness, so no
global argument repaired the row.

The production helper now emits four
`(carry_i, bit_multiplier - 1 - carry_i)` pairs in the existing
`range_check_8_8` domain. The two byte bounds prove exactly
`0 <= carry_i < bit_multiplier` on an active row. This adds two entries per
shift family: `shifts_reg` is pinned at 20 entries / 10 batches and
`shifts_imm` at 16 / 8 in both the AIR matrix and proof-artifact protocol.
`uniqueness_counterexample_test.zig` exhausts all 16,384 combinations of two
families, eight multipliers, four carry limbs, and 256 canonical byte
candidates, accepting exactly the values below the multiplier. The same test
keeps the original byte-clean negative-carry forgery and now attributes its
rejection to the fourth carry `range_check_8_8` request (entry 9 for
`shifts_imm`, 13 for `shifts_reg`). The extraction differential remains green
over all 17 families, and the divergence policy and ledger name the added
requests and geometry.

A bounded post-fix board did not produce a whole-family `unsat` verdict:
all three `shifts_imm` selector shards timed out at 60 s, and an isolated SRAI
query timed out at 180 s. No stronger solver claim is recorded. That budget
limitation does not leave the demonstrated bug open: the production row oracle
rejects the exact former counterexample, and the exhaustive table-membership
test proves the requested carry interval for every limb in both families.

**The eighth demonstrated under-constraint — CLOSED.** The pinned Stark-V
layout assigned every register and RW-memory access of one instruction the same
clock, while its `range_check_20(current - previous)` request admitted zero.
For an aliased instruction such as `ADD x3, x1, x1`, a forged second read
`(t, B) -> (t, B)` therefore cancelled identically from the memory relation and
let the opcode compute with arbitrary `B`.

Production now derives up to three source-before-destination access clocks
`A(c, i) = 4 * (c - 1) + i + 1`, for `i` in `{0, 1, 2}`, from the one-based
instruction clock. Residue zero in each four-wide bucket is reserved. Every
live access sends `current_access_clock - previous_clock - 1` to
`range_check_20`, so a zero gap becomes `p - 1` and cannot enter the table.
Long honest gaps retain the `2^20 - 1` bridge step. At the maximum `2^24`
instructions, live clocks are below `2^26`; clock-update predecessors use a
low20/high6 decomposition, with `(high6, 4 * high6)` in `range_check_8_8`
proving `high6 < 64`. Public register, output, and halt clocks are required to
be canonical live subclocks. The runner, every opcode AIR family, the
trace-only register-boundary derivation, clock-update component, independent
infrastructure checker, and public validation all use the same ordering
contract.

**The two long byte-product rows now close — proof scheduling, not an AIR
change.** Freshly extracted production IR closes all four `div`/`divu`/`rem`/
`remu` opcode shards and all three `mulh`/`mulhsu`/`mulhu` shards at a 20 s
per-query budget, with the declared input domains off and a satisfiable control
for every opcode. The former 5 s smoke budget became insufficient after the
strict access-clock expressions enlarged the emitted graph; the proof path is
unchanged. The final focused three-test regression completed in 38 wall
seconds on the audit machine. That timing is a measurement, not part of the
claim.

MULH uses a sequential two-copy ladder. It proves byte/carry witnesses in table
order, then each architectural output under only the agreements already
proved. A digit step keeps the lookup prefix through that digit and drops later
requests. This is proof-only weakening: an `unsat` over the larger assignment
set proves the complete AIR query, while `sat` is inconclusive and is reported
as `unknown`, never as a counterexample. Every range/window and projection
analysis is rebuilt from the same prefix; the regression compares its emitted
query byte-for-byte with physically deleting the requests. Each shard runs in
a disposable three-seed Z3 process portfolio. No solver state survives a
query, and any abnormal exit — including the reported 529 failure class —
remains `unknown`; worker lifecycle is not promoted to evidence.

DIV uses a smaller reviewed arithmetic consequence. Subtracting the two
eight-limb byte/carry recurrences cancels the shared dividend limbs even when
those input limbs are not locally byte-ranged; the bounded remaining terms
cannot wrap M31. The sign-extended recurrence first telescopes modulo `2^64`;
the opcode-specific canonical quotient signs and strict remainder bounds keep
the difference strictly inside that modulus, yielding
`C*Q_a + R_a = C*Q_b + R_b`. The sign, negation, high-to-low marker, and
positive-difference obligations give the sign-aligned strict remainder bound
for a nonzero divisor. For a zero divisor the direct constraints pin the same
opcode-specific quotient, after which the subtracted recurrence pins the
remainder. An independent integer query proves that two such rows have the same
quotient and remainder, while ordinary emitted two-copy queries prove the
operand/sign/zero prerequisites and bind those limbs to each real output in
separate proof steps. This manual derivation fails closed over SHA-256
`2feaee5ddd2b1f24a3264a2a09840a3dedb77c9761c8733f7980f9dee97b5d0a`,
which covers every extracted column, expression node, direct constraint,
lookup, and referenced table width/classification: every one-obligation
deletion, representative node/column mutations, and a table-width mutation
return `unknown`. Non-vacuity is not left to a hard search; a complete
`0 / 1 = 0` row with a nonzero destination is pinned and checked against the
unchanged one-copy AIR query for each opcode. The 17-family extraction
differential was rerun before the final board, and the freshly emitted DIV
system retained the certified digest.

**What the third `sat` was instead: a mis-posed query, fixed.** `load_store`'s
counterexample pair differed in `r2_idx` — the destination/data register index,
a component the row hands verbatim to its `program_access` tuple. That is
instruction identity: the program commitment holds one decoded tuple per pc and
independent verification recomputes its root from the supplied ELF, so two
traces presenting the same pc present the same `r2_idx`, exactly as they
present the same opcode flags and immediate, which the query already shared.
No family binds its instruction fields row-locally and none could; there was no
missing request to add. The emitter now promotes committed columns appearing
verbatim in the `program_access` tuple to inputs (`load_store.r2_idx` and
`fence.{rd,rs1}` moved; nothing else), with the same recorded assumption the pc
domain already carries — the program bus closes. After the promotion
`load_store` closes unique across all eight opcode shards, non-vacuously, and
no family moved toward `sat`.

What an `unsat` row on this board does not establish:

* nothing cross-row and nothing bus-mediated — read-set consistency, program
  binding and clock monotonicity are LogUp-closure properties the query
  neither models nor weakens;
* no refinement claim: a uniquely determined output can still be the wrong
  output. Agreement with the Sail transition is obligation 1 at the top of
  this file and is decided by the differential and the architectural corpus,
  never by this board;
* uniqueness is over inputs ranging across all of M31 except where a row
  obligation itself bounds them; the pc domain declaration exists but is off
  by default, so a verdict does not depend on it;
* the input promotion above imports program-bus closure as an assumption; a
  forged program commitment is out of scope here as it is everywhere row-local.

## Infrastructure components and cross-row composition — 2026-07-27

The 17-family board is no longer the only independently checked AIR surface.
`scripts/air_satisfaction.py` now re-decides all 28 canonical transcript
component kinds on an exported committed trace: the 17 opcode families,
program, RW-memory boundary, Merkle, Poseidon2, clock update, and all six
preprocessed lookup tables. It checks every implemented infrastructure direct
constraint and table request, infrastructure padding, every component claim,
the 28-slot transcript aggregation, public compensation, and global LogUp
closure. The all-family export is produced by one real proving run, verifies,
and reaches pinned Sail.

The infrastructure rows are not all unconditionally unique in isolation, so
the certificates state conditional theorems rather than relabelling bus inputs
as row-local outputs:

- `scripts/riscv_poseidon_table_uniqueness.py` proves the active narrow
  Poseidon2 schedule triangular: 16 inputs determine all 426 materialized
  cells and hence the 445-column main row. It separately exhausts the natural
  row → tuple mapping and singleton-LogUp recurrence for all six tables,
  retaining the required zero-denominator and inactive-row counterexamples.
- `scripts/riscv_infrastructure_uniqueness.py` binds the exact production
  requests for program, RW-memory, Merkle, and clock-update rows; proves the
  program and clock mixed-radix decompositions; checks small exact-multiset
  analogues for program binding and offline memory; and makes every
  integer-coefficient and root-connectivity premise explicit.
- `scripts/riscv_merkle_recurrence.py` proves the 30-step binary index/parity
  recurrence from the public root and the additive order of the depth
  decrement. Its retained counterexample showed that `n_rows < p` alone did
  not lift Merkle node coefficients: `(p-1)/2` rows of multiplicity two plus
  one row of multiplicity one vanish in M31 without vanishing over the
  integers. Production retains `2 * merkle_rows < p` and additionally requires
  `2 * merkle_rows + program_rows + memory_rows + 3 < p`. The combined rule
  covers malicious cross-source tuple collisions and supplies the all-source
  coefficient lift used by the conditional connectivity lemma.
- `scripts/riscv_state_chain_recurrence.py` binds the `+1` state clock,
  strict four-wide access-clock encoding, shifted live-gap lookup, long-gap
  bridges, predecessor decomposition, and no-wrap statement bounds to the
  production sources. It retains the historical wrapped-clock cycle and
  same-clock alias witnesses as negative controls.

The five global obligations are now explicit lemmas—offline memory
consistency, monotone clocks and `2^20` bridging, state telescoping and cycle
exclusion, program root ↔ executed word, and public boundary closure—in
`soundness/SAIL_AIR_COMPOSITION.md`. That document states conditional theorem
SA-1 and composes the cross-row lemmas with the runner/Sail evidence and
row-local work. It deliberately distinguishes exact AIR satisfaction,
production proof acceptance, and finite tested agreement.

This closes the missing *statement* of the composition argument and provides
machine checks for its finite arithmetic and graph premises. It does not close
the universal refinement theorem or the proof-system reduction: the repository
still has no independent PCS/FRI/proof-wire verifier, no externally reviewed
security-bit accounting, and no universal AIR-to-Sail refinement proof.

## Continuing adversarial work

- [x] Close the shift carry window (the seventh under-constraint above):
      every `bit_shift_carry` limb is paired with its complement in
      `shift_common`; the lookup and artifact geometry pins, divergence policy,
      and ledger are updated; and `uniqueness_counterexample_test.zig` both
      exhausts the exact byte window and attributes rejection of the former
      forged copy to the carry `range_check_8_8` request in each shift family.
- [x] Cover every opcode family with a pre-ingestion committed-row forgery and
      a paired honest prove → verify → pinned-Sail run. The canonical accounting
      is `FAMILY_COVERAGE` in
      `src/tests/riscv/opcode_family_committed_soundness_test.zig`: it is in the
      exact order of all seventeen families in `air/component_order.zig`, names
      the executable forgery and honest case for each one, requires every owner
      module to be registered by `trace_test.zig`, and fails at compile time on
      a missing family, reordered family, missing case marker, or unreachable
      owner.

      The same module owns `base_alu_imm`, `branch_lt`, `fence`, `jal`,
      `lt_imm`, `lt_reg`, `mul`, and `shifts_imm`, the eight families that had
      no case, and upgrades `lui` and `mulh` to the same adversary. The older
      CP-06 LUI and MULH cases mutate `.main` after interaction generation and
      remain useful prover-consistency checks, but they are deliberately not
      counted toward this stronger claim. The other owners are
      `auipc_alias_soundness_test.zig` (`auipc`),
      `bitwise_result_soundness_test.zig` (`base_alu_reg`),
      `read_only_access_soundness_test.zig` (`branch_eq`),
      `divisor_byte_range_soundness_test.zig` (`div`),
      `jalr_target_soundness_test.zig` (`jalr`),
      `partial_store_soundness_test.zig` (`load_store`), and
      `shift_sign_soundness_test.zig` (`shifts_reg`).

      This is family reachability and one malicious sample per family, not an
      exhaustive opcode/operand claim: only the `is_sb` half of the
      partial-store gate is exercised, only `SRL`/`SRA` of `shifts_reg`, and
      only `LB`/`LH`/`SB`/`SW`/`LW` of `load_store`.
- [x] Apply the committed-row override before multiplicity ingestion and
      interaction generation, so a row-locally coherent forgery reaches a real
      proof and loses the global LogUp closure at verification.
      `prover/test_witness_hook.applyOpcodeWitness` writes into
      `workspace.opcode_columns` ahead of `lookup_sources.ingest`; `.main` keeps
      its post-generation single-cell semantics and the two are documented apart
      at the hook. Seven end-to-end expectations moved from
      `.prover_constraints` to `.verification` as a result.
- [x] Keep `src/tests/riscv/proof_admission_test.zig` scoped to what it actually
      tests and put family enumeration in the committed-mutation suite above.
      The admission file checks that the injected engine is the proving
      substitution point for two traces: a runner-produced four-row
      `base_alu_imm` run and a hand-built one-row `mulh` run. It verifies
      neither proof and mutates no witness; its base-ALU runner trace alone is
      replayed through pinned Sail. Its module documentation and source
      contract state those limits explicitly.
- [x] Commit a generic witness-rigidity suite over all seventeen families: every
      committed column must be observable through a constraint or a lookup, no
      opcode selector may be interchangeable with another whose semantics differ,
      and every access must emit a value determined by constrained inputs. The
      third property is what the six closed items above all violated. Its own
      bounds, as `witness_rigidity_test.zig` states them: a per-family row
      budget over the committed ELF corpus, an exhaustive sweep of the byte
      domain on the first honest row of each family and a fixed delta sweep
      elsewhere, so rigidity is decided over that domain and not over all of
      M31; and two
      `load_store` address columns are recorded as knowingly unobservable rather
      than the check being weakened around them.
- [x] Repair the end-to-end non-byte DIVU divisor mutation (`[0, 0, 0, 256]`).
      Both halves of `divisor_byte_range_soundness_test.zig` are green with the
      `.verification` pin intact: the hook fix above is what made that pin
      satisfiable rather than the pin being relabelled. The stale
      `TODO(soundness)` in `air/semantics/div.zig` is replaced by a pointer to
      the test. The DIV divisor byte range still has no row-local check in
      `semantics/div.zig` itself and no recorded adversarial self-check.
- [ ] Add a deliberately malicious prover harness for skipped instructions,
      stale reads, forged outputs, and altered completion.
- [ ] Exhaustively check small-limb component domains where enumeration is
      feasible, with Sail transitions as the reference relation.
- [ ] Maintain serialized-proof bit-flip, truncation, splice, and wrong-statement
      rejection corpora as the wire evolves.
- [ ] Increase deterministic differential generation beyond the current
      checked corpus and record seed ranges and retirement counts.

## Independent verification and accounting

- [x] Proof artifacts are serialized and accepted only by a separate verifier
      invocation bound to an externally supplied statement digest.
- [x] Statement mutation and malformed-proof tests cover the public artifact
      boundary.
- [ ] Add a second independently implemented verifier for the RISC-V proof
      protocol. Sail and Spike independently validate execution semantics, not
      the repository-specific PCS/FRI proof wire. Nothing below closes this
      item: no second implementation reads a proof.

      One slice of it exists, named for what it is.
      `scripts/air_satisfaction.py` is an independent AIR **row-satisfaction and
      LogUp-closure checker**. It is not a verifier and must not be cited as
      one. It reads committed buffers exported from a real proving run
      (`src/tests/riscv/committed_trace_export_test.zig`, via the test-only
      `prover/test_trace_dump.zig`) together with the extracted per-family IR,
      and re-decides in Python, sharing no evaluator code with Zig:

        * committed-row placement for dense and sparse components;
        * every direct constraint of every real opcode row;
        * program, RW-memory, Merkle, Poseidon2, and clock-update direct
          constraints, including infrastructure padding;
        * every activated fixed-table request and the exact sparse
          multiplicity columns of all six lookup tables;
        * every opcode and infrastructure LogUp claim from rows and exported
          challenges;
        * all 28 canonical transcript slots, including shard aggregation and
          zero claims for absent opcode families;
        * the public boundary compensation as a second implementation of
          `air/public_logup.zig`; and
        * global cancellation using only recomputed claims and boundary terms.

      `all_families.json` contains all 17 opcode and all 11 infrastructure
      component kinds, with at least one active row in every opcode family.
      Its production run proves and verifies before export and reaches pinned
      Sail. The checker independently requires all 28 component claims to
      agree and the global sum to be zero.

      What it does not touch is what this item still asks for. The proof wire —
      PCS commitments, Merkle openings, FRI, the composition polynomial, OODS,
      and Fiat–Shamir transcript — is never read. The export is bound to the
      committed buffers by a code-level identity, not a cryptographic opening.
      Opcode padding remains outside the extracted active-row IR; infrastructure
      padding is checked. Bus tuples are recomputed and closed globally, but
      their exact-multiset interpretation still depends on randomized LogUp
      soundness and the integer-coefficient premises in
      `soundness/SAIL_AIR_COMPOSITION.md`.

      It is shown failing, which is the only reason a green run means anything.
      The bitwise forgery produces one attributed LOOKUP violation while its
      direct constraints vanish; a raised `ADDI` destination limb produces an
      attributed `base_alu_imm` CONSTRAINT violation. Infrastructure mutation
      tests cover every implemented row recurrence, selector, padding rule,
      table tuple, and claim source. Placement, QM31-tower, public-boundary, and
      transcript-order self-checks remain fail-closed in
      `scripts/tests/test_air_satisfaction.py`.
- [x] Publish the current conjectural security-bit accounting for every exposed
      PCS profile, explicitly separating it from a reviewed reduction.
- [ ] Obtain independent review of the FRI/list-decoding security accounting.
- [ ] Keep the Fiat–Shamir schedule and all domain-separated extensions in the
      conformance ledger with mutation coverage.

## Formal and external assurance

- [ ] Machine-check that AIR satisfaction refines the pinned Sail transition
      relation. The defensible partial result is now recorded as conditional
      theorem SA-1 in `soundness/SAIL_AIR_COMPOSITION.md`: all five cross-row
      obligations are explicit; the finite all-family committed corpus is
      independently re-decided; and every family has runner/AIR/Sail evidence.
      The item remains open because universal opcode-row refinement and the
      accepted-proof → exact-AIR reduction are not machine-proved. The complete
      engineering plan, theorem boundary, trusted computing base, LUI/ADDI
      pilot, LH/DIV stress gates, 46-opcode rollout, and completion criteria are
      specified in
      [`UNIVERSAL_AIR_SAIL_REFINEMENT.md`](UNIVERSAL_AIR_SAIL_REFINEMENT.md).
- [ ] Obtain independent AIR and protocol audits.
- [ ] Maintain a public bug-bounty scope for witness construction, statement
      binding, serialization, and verification.

Feature completion does not imply these longer-horizon audit items are done.
Conversely, they must not be represented as missing RV32IM instructions or as
authority for reintroducing a second semantic oracle.
