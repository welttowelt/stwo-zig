# Universal AIR → Sail refinement engineering plan

**Status:** engineering design; implementation not started.

**Primary result:** machine-check, for every input admitted by each of the 46
proof opcodes, that satisfaction of the shipped row AIR and its exact local
lookup obligations implements the corresponding transition of the pinned Sail
RV32IM model.

**Semantic authority:** `riscv/sail-riscv` at
`8c7f2da58de0ba5e4457e4de07e0046f0439f35f`, compiled with Sail `0.20.2`
under the profile fixed by
[`conformance/2026-07-26-riscv-sail-contract.md`](../conformance/2026-07-26-riscv-sail-contract.md).

**Composition target:** premise 5, “Universal local refinement,” of theorem
SA-1 in
[`soundness/SAIL_AIR_COMPOSITION.md`](SAIL_AIR_COMPOSITION.md).

This document is the engineering contract for the repository's main formal
semantics workstream. It is deliberately stricter than “run an SMT solver over
the current corpus.” Finite Sail agreement, committed-witness mutation tests,
and two-copy row uniqueness remain valuable evidence, but none quantifies over
every admitted architectural state. The result specified here does.

## 1. Objective and claim boundary

The project will prove a universal row theorem for every admitted opcode:

> Given a canonical instruction word, architectural pre-state, and memory
> observation admitted by the zkVM profile, every active row satisfying the
> production direct constraints, all activated fixed-table memberships, and
> the program/register/memory binding hypotheses projects to exactly the
> successful retirement produced by pinned Sail.

The projection includes all architecturally visible effects:

- decoded instruction identity;
- source-register values;
- destination-register presence, index, and value;
- next PC;
- load address and value;
- store address, width, mask, previous word, and next word;
- x0 behavior;
- instruction and access-clock tuples emitted to the cross-row relations; and
- absence of effects for instructions such as `FENCE`.

The theorem is universal over operands, register aliases, immediates, addresses,
memory words, and legal corner cases. It is not a finite enumeration of u32
values and is not inferred from uniqueness.

The completed result closes SA-1 premise 5. It does **not** by itself prove:

- that an accepted serialized proof binds an exact AIR witness;
- PCS commitment binding or FRI/list-decoding soundness;
- randomized LogUp soundness;
- Fiat–Shamir security;
- Poseidon2 collision resistance;
- the independent correctness of the proof-wire verifier; or
- byte compatibility with the retired Stark-V layout.

Those are computational-integrity obligations. In particular, this work must
not be described as a proof that every accepted production proof refines Sail
until SA-1 premise 1 has also been discharged under reviewed cryptographic
assumptions.

## 2. Why the existing evidence is insufficient

The repository already has unusually strong finite and row-local evidence:

- the runner agrees with pinned Sail and Spike on the committed formal corpus;
- 292 Sail-derived operand-class cases enter honestly admitted AIR rows;
- every one of the 17 AIR families has an end-to-end committed-row forgery;
- the production evaluator can emit canonical expression/lookup IR for all 17
  families;
- a fixed-seed extraction differential compares that IR with concrete
  evaluation;
- Z3 two-copy queries establish output uniqueness for the reviewed proof
  shards, including decomposed MULH and DIV arguments; and
- the independent Python AIR checker re-evaluates committed traces and global
  LogUp closure without sharing the Zig evaluator.

Each result answers a different question:

| Evidence | Question answered | Question not answered |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sail/Spike corpus | Did these executions agree? | Do all admitted executions agree? |
| Operand classes | Did each reviewed boundary class agree? | Are values inside each class universally correct? |
| Mutation fleet | Do named forgeries fail? | Can an untested wrong transition satisfy the AIR? |
| Two-copy uniqueness | Is the row output functionally determined under the modelled premises? | Is the determined function Sail's function? |
| Python AIR checker | Does this exported committed trace satisfy a second evaluator? | Does every satisfying row refine Sail? |

A uniquely determined wrong function is still wrong. The missing result is
therefore a refinement proof, not another agreement sweep.

## 3. Formal objects

The mechanization will define the following objects explicitly.

### 3.1 Architectural values

- `U32`: a 32-bit word with modular arithmetic.
- `RegisterIndex`: a five-bit index.
- `Pc`: a profile-admitted, four-byte-aligned instruction address.
- `MemoryWord`: four little-endian bytes.
- `InstructionWord`: the canonical 32-bit fetched word.
- `PreState`: PC plus the register observations used by one retirement.
- `MemoryObservation`: the aligned containing word and effective address
  required by a load or store.
- `Retirement`: normalized successful Sail output containing next PC, optional
  register write, and optional memory effect.

The normalized retirement intentionally omits Sail implementation detail that
is not visible at the zkVM boundary. Every omitted field must be justified in
the Sail bridge and must not influence a later architectural transition.

### 3.2 AIR row values

An AIR family has:

- a fixed ordered column vector over M31;
- an active selector;
- direct constraint expressions that must vanish;
- fixed-table requests whose numerators determine whether the request is live;
- bus requests for `program_access`, `registers_state`, and `memory_access`;
- the opcode selector and decoded program fields; and
- a projection identifying the row's claimed architectural effect.

Rows are represented over `ZMod (2^31 - 1)`. Byte, nibble, 11-bit, 20-bit, and
M31 range membership are separate predicates. A field value is never treated
as a u32 merely because a witness-generation function originally received a
u32.

### 3.3 Local row environment

Cross-row LogUp closure is not reproved separately inside every opcode theorem.
Instead, the local theorem receives an explicit environment containing the
facts supplied by SA-1's cross-row lemmas:

- the `program_access` tuple binds `pc` to one canonical decoded instruction;
- each source-register tuple supplies the latest preceding value for its
  register key;
- a load/store memory tuple supplies the latest preceding aligned memory word;
- a destination tuple consumes the correct predecessor and publishes the row's
  claimed successor;
- live accesses use the production strict subclock ordering; and
- all values used in integer lifts satisfy the production no-wrap bounds.

These hypotheses are interfaces, not shortcuts. The row proof must still show
that the tuple fields emitted by the row are the fields required by the Sail
transition. It may not assume the destination value or next PC that it is
supposed to prove.

### 3.4 Pinned Sail step

`SailStep profile pre word memory` is the successful one-instruction transition
of the pinned Sail model, normalized to `Retirement`. Rejection, trap, and
environment-control outcomes are represented separately.

The proof-bearing language contains successful RV32IM retirements plus the
repository's single-hart `FENCE` interpretation. ECALL, EBREAK, disabled
extensions, malformed encodings, misalignment, and trapped executions have no
active opcode row. The conservative `FENCE.I` exclusion remains an explicit
profile narrowing.

## 4. Required theorems

The result is divided into four theorem classes so a proof cannot hide a decode
or interface assumption inside the arithmetic.

### 4.1 Admission and decode refinement

For every 32-bit instruction word:

1. if the zkVM admits it, the word has exactly one opcode-manifest entry;
2. the program tuple is the canonical projection of that word;
3. the projection identifies the same successful instruction as pinned Sail,
   except for the documented conservative profile exclusions; and
4. a word outside the proof profile cannot activate an opcode row.

This is a bitvector theorem over all words, not a loop over the committed
positive and negative vectors.

### 4.2 Fixed-table interpretation

For each fixed lookup domain, prove once that membership means the integer fact
used by opcode proofs:

- `bitwise`;
- `range_check_20`;
- `range_check_8_11`;
- `range_check_8_8_4`;
- `range_check_8_8`; and
- `range_check_m31`.

The theorem must account for the lookup numerator. A zero numerator means no
request; a live numerator must establish exact table membership. Bounds inferred
from a lookup may not be used before liveness is proved.

### 4.3 Opcode-row refinement

For every opcode `o`:

```text
RowActive o row
∧ DirectConstraintsHold o row
∧ FixedLookupsHold o row
∧ ProgramBinds env row word
∧ OperandsBind env row pre memory
∧ ProfileAdmits profile pre word memory
→ RowProjection o row env
    = SailRetirementProjection (SailStep profile pre word memory)
```

The Lean theorem will quantify over the row, state, word, and memory
observation. Each proof must establish both the architectural result and the
row's emitted relation tuples.

### 4.4 Non-vacuity

Every opcode needs a machine-checked existence theorem:

```text
∃ row pre word memory,
  RowActive o row
  ∧ DirectConstraintsHold o row
  ∧ FixedLookupsHold o row
  ∧ ProgramBinds ...
  ∧ OperandsBind ...
```

Without this, inconsistent constraints could make the refinement implication
vacuously true. The existing operand-class and honest witness generators can
provide concrete witnesses, but the resulting existence proof must be checked
by Lean against the same generated AIR definition.

## 5. Proof architecture

The implementation has four independently auditable stages:

```text
production Zig AIR                 pinned Sail model
       |                                  |
       v                                  v
canonical AIR IR                   generated Sail semantics
       |                                  |
       +-------------+  +-----------------+
                     v  v
               normalized Lean models
                     |
                     v
         per-opcode universal refinement proofs
                     |
                     v
       exact 46-opcode coverage and SA-1 premise 5
```

No Rust semantic oracle appears in this pipeline. Stark-V layout information is
irrelevant to the theorem.

### 5.1 Proof kernel

Lean 4 is the selected proof kernel. The repository will pin:

- the Lean toolchain;
- every non-core Lean dependency;
- the Sail compiler and theorem-backend invocation;
- generator source digests; and
- canonical generated AIR and Sail output digests.

The final CI result is a Lean kernel check. Z3 may generate counterexamples,
identify useful lemmas, or guide proof decomposition, but a Z3 `unsat` response
is not the publication artifact and is outside the trusted proof conclusion.

### 5.2 Lean representations

The preferred representations are:

- M31 values as `ZMod 2147483647`;
- architectural words as `BitVec 32`;
- bytes as `Fin 256`;
- register indices as `Fin 32`;
- fixed-size row columns as `Fin n → ZMod p`;
- range-table meanings as arithmetic predicates rather than enumerated arrays;
  and
- normalized Sail retirement effects as a small structure with optional writes.

The bridge library will prove:

- canonical byte recomposition and decomposition;
- injectivity of bounded integer embeddings into M31;
- when a field equality can be lifted to an integer equality;
- two's-complement sign-extension lemmas;
- u32 addition/subtraction wraparound;
- bit extraction and mask lemmas;
- aligned address split/recomposition;
- strict access-subclock encoding; and
- quotient/remainder corner-case lemmas used by RV32M.

Proofs should use kernel-checked simplification, arithmetic normalization, and
bitvector reflection. Native execution or an external solver must not introduce
an unreviewed axiom into the core theorem.

## 6. Binding the proof to the shipped AIR

This is the most important engineering risk. A beautiful proof of a manually
rewritten AIR is not a proof of the production system.

### 6.1 Current extraction

`src/tests/riscv/uniqueness_ir_test.zig` evaluates the generic production
semantics with a symbolic scalar and emits:

- ordered columns and roles;
- the expression DAG;
- direct constraint roots;
- lookup numerators, domains, tuples, and labels; and
- row inputs and architectural outputs.

It also runs a 17-family, fixed-seed differential between symbolic and concrete
evaluation. This is a strong pilot foundation, but the random differential is
not a universal source-binding proof.

### 6.2 Canonical refinement IR

The pilot will extend the existing format rather than invent a second AIR
export. The canonical refinement IR must add:

- schema version;
- opcode selector and exact manifest entry;
- production source-path and source-digest manifest;
- family and opcode IDs;
- column names, indices, roles, and widths;
- active-row predicate;
- every direct constraint in evaluation order;
- every fixed-table and bus request;
- decoded program-field projection;
- architectural effect projection;
- access ordinals;
- table schema digests;
- M31 modulus and integer-bound metadata; and
- a canonical content digest.

Generated files are deterministic and duplicate JSON fields are rejected.
Column, constraint, lookup, or table-order drift changes the digest.

### 6.3 Binding gates

There are two acceptable implementation levels:

1. **Pilot binding:** invoke the same generic Zig semantics functions used by
   production with the symbolic IR collector, pin the emitted digest, and keep
   the existing concrete differential as a fail-closed regression.
2. **Publication binding:** make the production evaluator and the Lean export
   consume one canonical constraint program by construction, or produce a
   kernel-checkable translation certificate showing that every production
   evaluator event occurs in the exported program with the same operands and
   order.

Level 1 is sufficient to develop LUI, ADDI, load, and DIV proofs. The project
must not claim a universal theorem about the shipped AIR until level 2 is
complete. Random testing, however extensive, cannot substitute for it.

The preferred level-2 design is a single typed `ConstraintProgram` builder:
production interprets it over concrete field expressions; export serializes the
same program; Lean interprets the serialization. This minimizes semantic code
duplication and makes a changed constraint invalidate both the production hash
and the proof build.

## 7. Binding the proof to pinned Sail

The other unacceptable shortcut is a hand-written “Sail-like” Lean function.

### 7.1 Generated semantics

The pinned Sail model must be compiled through a theorem-prover backend into a
Lean-consumable transition definition. The generation receipt binds:

- Sail repository and commit;
- Sail compiler version;
- exact model entry points;
- RV32 configuration and extension settings;
- repository-owned profile normalization;
- generated-file digests; and
- the normalization bridge version.

The RVFI transport entry patch used by executable differential testing is not an
ISA semantic rule and must not silently enter the theorem model.

### 7.2 Normalization bridge

Raw generated Sail state is expected to be much larger than one zkVM retirement.
A reviewed bridge maps it to the repository's normalized `Retirement`:

- `next_pc`;
- optional `(rd, value)`;
- optional memory read observation;
- optional masked memory write;
- success/rejection classification; and
- no other externally visible state change.

For every admitted opcode, Lean must prove that normalization preserves all
fields observed by the next transition. The bridge may erase logging,
interpreter bookkeeping, or inactive extension state only after proving it
irrelevant.

If the pinned Sail revision cannot be compiled directly into usable Lean, the
fallback is a generated normalized semantics capsule plus a checked translation
receipt from the Sail AST. Hand-transcribing 46 instruction functions and
validating them only with test vectors is not an acceptable fallback.

### 7.3 Decode narrowing

The Sail bridge owns one explicit difference: the zkVM rejects `FENCE.I` while
the pinned model currently retires it despite the disabled Zifencei setting.
The admission theorem expresses the zkVM language as a conservative subset and
proves refinement only for that subset. It must not weaken or override the
semantics of an admitted instruction.

## 8. Pilot: LUI and ADDI

The first milestone is complete only when both opcodes are universally proved
and non-vacuous from generated AIR and generated Sail definitions.

### 8.1 LUI

LUI is the minimal vertical slice. The proof covers:

- U-type decode and canonical immediate projection;
- all 20-bit immediates;
- placement in bits 31:12;
- zero low 12 bits;
- all destination registers, including `rd = x0`;
- next PC;
- the program tuple;
- source-free register-state behavior; and
- destination relation emission.

LUI is intentionally first because a failure is likely to indicate a broken
translation or theorem interface rather than difficult arithmetic.

### 8.2 ADDI

ADDI validates the first reusable arithmetic library. The proof covers:

- I-type decode;
- every sign-extended 12-bit immediate;
- byte decomposition;
- carry constraints;
- u32 modular addition;
- positive and negative immediates;
- overflow and underflow;
- `rd = rs1` source-before-destination aliasing;
- `rd = x0`;
- next PC; and
- exact register/program relation tuples at derived access subclocks.

The pilot fails if it proves only an ADDI output formula while ignoring the
source read, destination predecessor, tuple clock, or x0 path.

### 8.3 Pilot exit criteria

- `lake build` checks both theorems from a clean checkout.
- `#print axioms` reports no unapproved axiom for either theorem.
- No `sorry`, `admit`, theorem-local `axiom`, or opaque unchecked certificate is
  present.
- AIR and Sail generated digests are pinned in one receipt.
- Honest existence theorems establish non-vacuity.
- Removing the LUI low-limb constraint breaks its proof or yields a checked
  counterexample.
- Removing an ADDI carry/range obligation breaks its proof or yields a checked
  counterexample.
- The existing Sail corpus and Zig exhaustive tests remain green.

## 9. Stress validation: signed load and DIV

The pipeline is not considered scalable merely because LUI and ADDI work.
Before broad rollout it must survive one memory-heavy family and the hardest
integer-arithmetic family.

### 9.1 Signed LH stress case

The load milestone proves `LH` universally, including:

- I-immediate address calculation with wraparound;
- natural halfword alignment;
- low-half and high-half selection from the aligned memory word;
- little-endian byte order;
- negative and nonnegative halfwords;
- sign extension to 32 bits;
- `rd = rs1` aliasing;
- memory read-only preservation;
- register and memory access order;
- effective address and aligned-word bus tuples; and
- the destination write.

An honest witness must include a negative high-half case, because a zero or
positive low-half witness would not exercise the sign path. After `LH`, the
same bridge must be capable of proving `LB`, `LW`, `LBU`, and `LHU` without
changing the theorem interface.

### 9.2 DIV-family stress case

The DIV milestone covers all four selectors—`DIV`, `DIVU`, `REM`, and
`REMU`—because their shared AIR contains selector-dependent corner cases. It
must prove:

- byte/carry recomposition of dividend, divisor, quotient, and remainder;
- signed and unsigned interpretations;
- quotient truncation toward zero;
- remainder magnitude and sign;
- divisor zero conventions;
- signed overflow at `INT_MIN / -1`;
- high-bit unsigned operands;
- quotient-sign witness binding;
- the nonzero-divisor comparison witness; and
- exact destination and relation projections.

Required named witnesses include signed overflow, signed negative remainder,
zero divisor, and the historical high-bit `0x8abcdef1 / 1` DIVU case.

Z3 may continue to supply the existing arithmetic decomposition as a discovery
aid. The final DIV theorem and its supporting integer lemmas must be checked by
Lean.

### 9.3 Stress-gate decision

If either LH or the DIV family requires a different semantic model, AIR IR, or
row-environment interface, the design is revised before any additional family
is claimed. This gate exists to prevent scaling a pilot architecture that works
only for straight-line ALU rows.

## 10. Scaling across all 46 opcodes

The implementation scales by 17 AIR-family proof frameworks, but completion is
tracked by opcode. A family theorem with an unproved selector case does not
cover that opcode.

| AIR family | Opcodes | Count | Principal proof obligations | Risk |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `base_alu_reg` | ADD, SUB, XOR, OR, AND | 5 | byte/carry or bitwise result, aliases | medium |
| `base_alu_imm` | ADDI, XORI, ORI, ANDI | 4 | sign extension, byte/carry, bitwise | medium |
| `shifts_reg` | SLL, SRL, SRA | 3 | masked shift amount, carries, sign fill | high |
| `shifts_imm` | SLLI, SRLI, SRAI | 3 | immediate decode, carries, sign fill | high |
| `lt_reg` | SLT, SLTU | 2 | signed/unsigned comparison | medium |
| `lt_imm` | SLTI, SLTIU | 2 | immediate sign extension and comparison | medium |
| `branch_eq` | BEQ, BNE | 2 | predicate and two next-PC paths | medium |
| `branch_lt` | BLT, BGE, BLTU, BGEU | 4 | signedness, predicate complement, target | high |
| `lui` | LUI | 1 | U-immediate projection | low |
| `auipc` | AUIPC | 1 | U-immediate, PC addition, rd/x0 behavior | medium |
| `jalr` | JALR | 1 | signed immediate, wraparound, bit-zero clear, target bound | high |
| `jal` | JAL | 1 | J-immediate, link value, target | medium |
| `load_store` | LB, LH, LW, LBU, LHU, SB, SH, SW | 8 | memory word masks, sign, preservation, aliases | high |
| `mul` | MUL | 1 | low product and carry recurrence | high |
| `mulh` | MULH, MULHSU, MULHU | 3 | signed 64-bit product and high projection | very high |
| `div` | DIV, DIVU, REM, REMU | 4 | quotient/remainder and exceptional cases | very high |
| `fence` | FENCE | 1 | decode, PC+4, absence of effects | low |
| **Total** |  | **46** |  |  |

Recommended rollout order after the stress gate:

1. LUI, FENCE, JAL;
2. base ALU register/immediate;
3. comparisons and branches;
4. shifts;
5. AUIPC and JALR;
6. remaining loads and stores;
7. MUL;
8. MULH variants; and
9. remaining DIV/REM selector cases.

Within each family, shared lemmas are proved once and selector-specific
theorems instantiate them. Coverage automation compares theorem names and
opcode IDs against `src/frontends/riscv/opcode_manifest.zig`; an omitted,
duplicated, or renamed opcode fails closed.

## 11. Planned repository layout

The implementation should use one self-contained formal project:

```text
formal/riscv-refinement/
  lean-toolchain
  lakefile.lean
  lake-manifest.json
  RiscvRefinement/
    Field.lean
    Word.lean
    AccessClock.lean
    Air/
      IR.lean
      Interpreter.lean
      Tables.lean
      Generated/
    Sail/
      Generated/
      Normalize.lean
      Profile.lean
    Bridge/
      Decode.lean
      ProgramTuple.lean
      RegisterTuple.lean
      MemoryTuple.lean
    Opcodes/
      Lui.lean
      BaseAluImm.lean
      LoadStore.lean
      Div.lean
      ...
    Coverage.lean
    NonVacuity.lean
  generated-manifest.json
```

Repository tooling should be owned under:

```text
scripts/riscv_refinement.py
scripts/riscv_refinement_lib/
```

The tool owns generation, digest checking, coverage reporting, and clean-room
reproduction. It does not prove theorems itself.

Generated Lean files may be committed if that materially improves review and
offline reproducibility. If committed, CI regenerates them into a temporary
directory and requires byte identity. Generated files are never edited by
hand.

## 12. CI and change control

The following commands are planned interfaces, not commands available at the
date of this document:

```sh
zig build riscv-refinement-ir
python3 scripts/riscv_refinement.py generate
python3 scripts/riscv_refinement.py check-generated
python3 scripts/riscv_refinement.py coverage
lake --dir formal/riscv-refinement build
python3 scripts/riscv_refinement.py receipt
```

### 12.1 Required PR checks

Once the pilot lands, every PR touching the following surfaces triggers the
refinement build:

- `src/frontends/riscv/opcode_manifest.zig`;
- `src/frontends/riscv/isa/**`;
- `src/frontends/riscv/air/semantics/**`;
- opcode trace columns or lookup-entry generation;
- fixed lookup-table schemas;
- program decode;
- access-clock encoding;
- generated AIR IR or its generator;
- Sail pin, compiler, configuration, or normalization;
- Lean proof sources; or
- refinement manifests and receipts.

The check fails on:

- generated drift;
- unknown IR schema;
- a changed source or table digest;
- an uncovered opcode;
- any `sorry` or unapproved axiom;
- theorem build failure;
- missing non-vacuity;
- a changed Sail normalization surface;
- timeout in a required kernel proof; or
- a proof that depends on an undeclared package.

### 12.2 Tiering

- **Pilot CI:** LUI and ADDI plus source-generation checks.
- **Stress CI:** LH and the complete DIV family.
- **Full CI:** all 46 opcode theorems and non-vacuity.
- **Scheduled clean-room build:** regenerate pinned Sail and AIR definitions
  from empty caches, build every theorem, and publish a signed receipt.

Once full coverage is practical, semantic changes must run the full check on
every PR. A nightly-only universal theorem is too weak for a release branch.

### 12.3 Receipt

The machine-readable receipt contains:

- schema;
- implementation commit and dirty state;
- Lean version and dependency lock digest;
- Sail repository, commit, compiler, and configuration digest;
- AIR IR schema and per-opcode digests;
- fixed-table schema digests;
- generator digests;
- 46 exact opcode/theorem mappings;
- non-vacuity theorem mappings;
- theorem build result;
- declared axioms for every exported theorem;
- wall-clock diagnostics; and
- final canonical receipt digest.

Timing is diagnostic. Coverage, pins, hashes, and proof results are normative.

## 13. Proof-review discipline

Every family requires three reviewers with distinct questions:

1. **AIR reviewer:** does the generated row projection correspond to the
   production columns and relation tuples?
2. **Sail/profile reviewer:** does the normalized Sail result preserve every
   field visible to the zkVM?
3. **formal-proof reviewer:** do the lemmas prove the stated universal result
   without hidden axioms, vacuity, or unjustified integer lifts?

The same person may implement more than one layer, but the Sail normalization
bridge and the AIR source-binding gate require independent sign-off.

Proof review uses generated names and source anchors. A 500-line tactic proof
that no longer exposes which constraint or lookup supplies a fact must be
refactored before acceptance.

## 14. Negative controls

Green theorem builds need demonstrated sensitivity. The refinement tooling will
maintain mutation controls that alter generated input in a temporary directory
and require either:

- a Lean proof failure; or
- a concrete counterexample checked against the mutated AIR and pinned Sail.

Mandatory pilot/stress mutations include:

- free LUI low immediate limb;
- deleted ADDI carry or immediate-range request;
- free LH sign witness;
- unpreserved load memory word;
- non-byte DIV divisor limb;
- free DIV quotient sign;
- deleted zero-divisor convention;
- JALR target-bit release; and
- one selector relabelling inside each shared family.

These controls do not strengthen the theorem; they establish that the pipeline
is connected to the obligations it claims to prove.

## 15. Work packages and gates

Deliver:

- this document reviewed;
- Lean toolchain decision and dependency policy;
- exact theorem signatures;

### UR-05 — complete 46-opcode rollout

Deliver:

- all remaining family lemmas;
- exact opcode coverage;
- all non-vacuity theorems;
- full negative-control manifest; and
- bounded, reproducible proof times.

Exit gate: coverage matches the opcode manifest exactly.

### UR-06 — production source binding

Deliver:

- one canonical constraint program used by production and formal export, or an
  equivalent checked translation certificate;
- per-opcode production digests;
- clean regeneration; and
- source-change invalidation tests.

Exit gate: the theorem is legitimately about the shipped AIR, not merely the
pilot export.

### UR-07 — SA-1 integration and research artifact

Deliver:

- SA-1 premise 5 marked machine-proved;
- public theorem and assumption index;
- clean-room reproduction package;
- proof statistics and engineering evaluation;
- external replication; and
- paper-ready description of the generated refinement pipeline.

Exit gate: a third party can regenerate the models and kernel-check every
opcode theorem from the pinned inputs.

## 16. Principal risks and mitigations

| Risk | Failure mode | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AIR translation gap | Proof covers a model different from production | Single-source constraint program or checked translation certificate |
| Sail backend complexity | Generated state is too large or unsupported | Prove a reviewed normalization bridge; do not hand-recode semantics |
| Vacuous implication | Inconsistent AIR “proves” everything | Per-opcode existence theorems and honest witnesses |
| Field/integer confusion | M31 equality is lifted past wraparound | Central bounded-lift lemmas with explicit hypotheses |
| Lookup liveness error | Range fact is inferred from an inactive request | Prove numerator liveness before table membership |
| Bus/local mismatch | Row output is right but emitted tuple is wrong | Include all bus tuple projections in each theorem |
| Tactic brittleness | Small generated changes explode proof scripts | Family lemmas, normalized IR, stable semantic interfaces |
| Nonlinear arithmetic | MULH/DIV proofs do not scale | Integer lemmas and staged decompositions, discovered with SMT but checked in Lean |
| Coverage drift | New opcode or selector has no theorem | Exact manifest-to-theorem coverage check |
| Pin drift | Proof silently moves to another Sail meaning | Generated receipts and byte-identical regeneration |

## 17. Definition of done

“Universal AIR → Sail refinement” is complete only when all of the following
hold:

- the pinned Sail semantics are generated and normalized under a reviewed
  bridge;
- the formal AIR is bound to the production evaluator at publication level;
- all six fixed-table meanings are proved;
- admission/decode refinement is universal;
- every one of the 46 opcode IDs maps to one checked theorem;
- each theorem covers architectural output and emitted relation tuples;
- every opcode has a non-vacuity theorem;
- no exported theorem uses `sorry`, `admit`, or an undeclared axiom;
- required mutations demonstrate pipeline sensitivity;
- CI regenerates and kernel-checks everything from clean inputs;
- SA-1 premise 5 is updated to cite the exact theorem receipt; and
- an independent party reproduces the result.

Before that point, acceptable language is:

> “LUI/ADDI refinement pilot,” “memory/DIV stress mechanization,” or
> “N of 46 opcodes machine-proved.”

After that point, the precise claim is:

> “Every exact active row admitted by the shipped RV32IM AIR universally
> refines the pinned Sail transition under the explicit program, state, memory,
> range, and no-wrap premises.”

Even then, the project must not collapse the claim into “every accepted proof
is a correct Sail execution” until the independent proof-system validation and
reviewed PCS/FRI/Fiat–Shamir reduction close SA-1 premise 1.
